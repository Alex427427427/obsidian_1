Free indices must appear exactly once in every term. When an index appears once at the top and once at the bottom, a sum occurs. This is to greatly simplify the occurrence that, whenever an index matches at top and bottom:
$$X^\mu=\sum_\nu {\Lambda^\mu}_\nu X^\nu$$
We instead write:
$$X^\mu={\Lambda^\mu}_\nu X^\nu$$
Whenever this happens, we say the index $\nu$ has been **contracted**. Contractions are like inner products, and are the main things that are invariant under coordinate transformations. But we are not allowed to multiply two vectors together. According to the free index rule, $X^\mu X^\mu$ is not allowed. So how do we perform an inner product? With [[4 The Metric Tensor]].
