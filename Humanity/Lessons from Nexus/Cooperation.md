Some believe that the world follows the law of the jungle. This is false. See [[The False Law of the Jungle]].

**The clearest trend is not constant conflict, but rather an increase of cooperation**. 

10000- years ago sapiens could only cooperate at the level of bands. Over millenia we found ways to create communities of strangers first on the level of tribes then religious trade networks and states. Realists should note that states are not the fundamental particles of human reality, but the product of arduous processes of building trust and cooperation. If humans were only interested in power, they could never have created states in the first place. Conflicts have always been a possibility, but never an inescapable destiny. 

**The scope of information technology determines the scope of human cooperation**. The radio and the newspaper gave rise to large scale democracy and large scale totalitarianism. Today, it may even make a unified global empire possible. 

What makes global cooperation difficult is the misguided notion that it requires abolishment of cultural social and political differences. French nationalist Le Pen: "now the divide is between globalists and patriots." Trump: "we have chosen patriotism over globalism." This binary populist (see [[Populism]]) view is mistaken. Patriotism is not mutually exclusive to cooperation. Patriotism is about loving compatriots, and many times it is necessary to cooperate with foreigners to achieve that goal. Take Covid 19. 

Populists argue that if the international community agrees on a common story and on universal norms and values, this will destroy the independence and unique traditions of their own nation. 

**But for Sapiens the precondition for cooperation isn't similarity, but the ability to exchange information**. As long as we can converse, we may be able to find a shared story that brings us together. This is what made sapiens the dominant species on the planet, after all. 

Unlike what populists believe, globalism dose not mean opening borders to unlimited immigration, or abolishing national loyalty. It means two much more mundane things: 

1. Commitment to some global rules. These rules don't deny the uniqueness of each nation but only regulates the relationship between them. Much like laws between humans. A good model is the world cup. it's a competition between nations where people can be quite patriotic. Yet, amazingly, everyone agrees on the rules that determine win and loss for soccer. The world cup is an amazing display of global agreement despite the desire to retain identity. 
2. Sometimes but not always, it's necessary to prioritise the long term interests of all humans over the short term interests of a few. In the world cup, all nations agree not to use performance enhancing drugs because that means in the long run it becomes a competition between biochemists.
