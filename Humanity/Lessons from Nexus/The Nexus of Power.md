In totalitarian regimes, only one person needs to be manipulated - the person at the top. 

### Example
Sejanus of the Praetorian guards, originally established by Augustus (first Roman Emperor) as a body guard force, took advantage of and exacerbated the paranoia of Tiberius (second Roman Emperor) who lacked Augustus' wisdom to maintain multiple prefects for the guard. Sejanus would often report fictitious assassination attempts of Tiberius, until Tiberius trusted no one but Sejanus and set him as the sole prefect of the Praetorian guards. Tiberius was encouraged to live in a remote island away from the metropolis of traitors and conspirators. Sejanus took control of Rome. 

Eventually information slipped through the crack of Tiberius' information cage - a letter from his sister informing him of what has happened to Rome. Tiberius snuck back, gained the support of a fire watch guard who orchestrated a coup against Sejanus. The fire watch was set as the new Praetorian guard. Years later, the fire watch killed Tiberius.

### Nexus
Those who control the nexus have the power to control the world. 

Power used to be tied to land. So emperors could not hold unchallenged power for long. Land is impossible to literally concentrate, so must be distributed to delegates. 

Then power was tied to machines, factories, and industry. The hubs of production. But still those hubs relied on land where raw materials originate. 

Today it is information. Data colonies can send data to central hubs, where engineers that design algorithms control the fate of the world. 

**The nexus of power lies at where information channels converge.** 
Since Tiberius allowed the information channels to merge in the person of Sejanus, the latter became the true center of power, while Tiberius was reduced to a puppet.
