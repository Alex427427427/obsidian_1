Jews and early Christians actually believed not in souls but only flesh. God made humans with flesh bodies with no mention of souls. Salvation is literally a material kingdom on earth. When the messiah comes to bring about it, there will be resurrection in the flesh, to inhabit a kingdom on earth. No mention of souls or an immaterial plane. 

By 4th Century this idea has changed. An immaterial soul is posited and most Christians believe this today. Earliest example was Paul. 

Later on monk Luther who tortured his body for 10 years hoping for salvation did not receive it, decided that no bodily work could lead to salvation, only faith in his head.
