Romanian secret police "Securitate" sent an agent to wordlessly observe a computer expert bureaucrat for a decade, who at the end didn't even know their name. 

There are not enough agents to monitor the whole population day and night. Let alone agents to monitor the agents. (romanian secret police chief defected to US.) 
Thus there is still effectively privacy in Romanian life. 

However, the idea that anyone could be monitored, was enough to fear people and make them watch what they say and do.
