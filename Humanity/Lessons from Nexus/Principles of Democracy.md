___
### Most defining traits
Distributed information networks. 
Robust self correcting mechanisms. 

### Yuval's principles:
1. benevolence
2. decentralisation: a democratic society should never allow its information to be concentrated in some central hub, whether government or corporation. Some inefficiency is a feature, not a bug. Medical databases bring merged with insurance companies or the police database, may make each profession's workers more efficient, but is a bad idea. (unwarranted persecution). Multiple databases are essential for maintaining strong self correcting mechanisms. They require several institutions that balance each other. Gov, courts, media, academia, business. Each is fallible and corruptible, so should be checked by others. To keep an eye on each other, they should have independent access to information. A single archive makes censorship easy. 
3. Mutuality (information symmetry). It is not necessarily bad if more information is collected about its citizens, if the surveillance on governments and corporations receive a proportional increase. 
4. Opportunity to change and rest. The same medical information can be used to deny services, or to help change the future. We should strive not to view information as discovering preordained destinies, but rather an opportunity to change the future.
