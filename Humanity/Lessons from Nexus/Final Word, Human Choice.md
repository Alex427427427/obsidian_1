### The False Determinisms
There is little effective determinism at play. 
- Technological determinism is non existent - the scope of information technology only expands the possibilities, and does not dictate which possibility will be realised. 
- History does not bend towards justice. It is a radically open arc, one that can reach very different destinations. 
- The law of the jungle is false. If leaders believe the world can only be dog eat dog, then the only choice is to be predator or prey. 

Even if sapiens destroy themselves, the universe will keep going about its business as usual. It took 4 billion years for terrestrial evolution to produce a civilisation of highly intelligent apes. If we are gone, and it takes evolution another hundred million years to produce a civilisation of highly intelligent rats, it will. The universe is patient. 
There is a worse scenario. As far as we know, the lives on planet earth are the only conscious entities in the universe. We are now in the process of summoning a very powerful and alien intelligence. If we mishandle it, the human dominion over earth may not be the only thing that is extinguished, but the light of consciousness itself, turning the universe into a realm of utter darkness. 

### What to do
- Acknowledge the falsehood of the law of the jungle
- Abandon technological and historical determinism, take responsibility of human choice
- Abandon the naive and populist views of information
- Put aside fantasies of infallibility
- Commit to the hard and mundane work of institution building with strong self correcting mechanisms

This wisdom is much older than human history. It is elemental and the foundation of organic life. The first organisms were not created by an infallible god, but intricate yet chaotic trial and error. Over billions of years, ever mor complex self correction and mutation led to trees, dinosaurs, jungles and sapiens. 

### Human Choice
Accepting that conflict is evitable should not invite complacency, but place heavy responsibility. If human civilisation is consumed by conflict, we cannot blame it on law of nature or alien technology. 

**If we make the effort we can create a better world. This is not naivety, this is realism. Every old thing was once new. The only constant of history is change.**
