Democracy is a distributed information network. 
Its defining trait is that, and not dictatorship by the majority as is commonly thought. In addition, robust **error correcting mechanisms**. 
Populists believe democracy should be dictatorship by the majority, thus arguing the institutions that provide checks and balances are anti-democratic. The truth is not so. 

Totalitarianism is a centralised information network. 
It usually lacks resilient error correct mechanisms. 
It has the calculation problem. 

Modernity has created large scale democracy and large scale totalitarianisms, both were not possible in the past due to technology.
