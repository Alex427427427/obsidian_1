The new iron curtain. China has its own internet. Increasingly so for Russia, not in apps but in regulation. Code in smart phones decide which side of the silicon curtain you land on. 

Each sphere of the silicon curtain obeys different regulations and serve different purposes. 
In China, information tech has the primary goal to strengthen the government. In the US, to enrich the tech giants. 

US is banning the selling of chips to China crucial for AI dev. In the short run this results in a slow down of China's progress but in the long run this pushes China to dev their own ecosystem of hardware and software that is alien to Western technology.

**After centuries of convergence, humanity is splitting.** Information technology that once helped fuel globalisation is now so powerful that it's capable of supporting completely different spheres. The web may become cocoons.
