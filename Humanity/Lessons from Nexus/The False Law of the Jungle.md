Grim view of international relations ([[The International Arena]]): realism / anarchy, by political scientist mearsheimer.

Frans de Waal, primatologist suggests that at heart humans are stone age hunters who cannot but see the world as a jungle where the strong prey upon the weak and where might makes right. This "veneer theory" argues that for millenia humans have tried to camouflage this unchanging reality under a thin mutable veneer of myths and rituals but we have never really broken free from the laws of the jungle. 

Indeed, myths are used as a weapon by the jungle's top dogs to deceive the inferiors, and those blind to this fact are dangerously naive. 

**However, there are reasons to believe that this law itself is a myth.** As Frans de Waal and many other biologists have studied and documented, the real jungle is filled with cooperation and symbiosis. 80 percent of plants are symbiotic with fungi. 90 percent of vascular plants are symbiotic with microorganisms. If organisms in the rain forests abandoned cooperation in favour of all out competition for hegemony, the forest and the inhabitants would quickly die. That is the real law of the jungle. (also see game theory, the spontaneous appearance and proliferation of cooperative behaviour)

Primitive humans too, lack evidence of irrepressible war-like tendencies. Organised warfare emerged in archarological evidence about 13000 years ago. After that, war is variable rather than a constant. The clearest pattern we observe in the long term history of humanity isn't the constancy of war, but the increasing scale of cooperation.
