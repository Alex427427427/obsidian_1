The conflict of progressive and conservative ideals propel social progress. 

Progressives: there are unjust / irrational / inefficient aspects to the current way of things, and change must be adopted. 

Conservatives: while the current way of things has downsides, it is the culmination of generations of trial and error, forming a complex web of cultural customs and institutional rules that is hard to comprehend but nevertheless have reasons to exist. Let's be cautious changing things with unforeseen consequences. 

For the conservatives, it is largely about pacing, and not a particular ideology. 

Yet in recent years, there has been a complete reversal of this dynamic. Conservatives are now radical revolutionaries that want to dismantle institutions and build new ones. While progressives fall back to the position of protectors of the existing institutions.
