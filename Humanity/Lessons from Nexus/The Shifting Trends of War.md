**Nuclear bomb drastically increased the cost of war. The shift from material economy to information economy drastically reduced the gains of war.** 

For most recorded history, military was the number one budget of every empire, kingdom, republic. Little was spent on healthcare and education, people were busy building armies and walls. 

Song Dynasty bureaucrats examined the budget and said: if all the wealth under heaven were split into 6 shares, 5 are spent on the military, and the rest on all other state affairs. How can the country not be poor and the people in difficulty?

Roman: 50-75%.
Ottomans: 60%
pre-contemporary Britain: 75%
pre-contemporary France: 90%
Prussia, 75-90%

21st Century world wide average military expenditure: 7%. 
US, 13%. 
Average expenditure on healthcare: 10%. 

This trend was not due to divine miracle but human choices in their laws, myths, and institutions. It is reversible. 

2020s military budget are increasing. Russia increased to 30% before invading Ukraine.
