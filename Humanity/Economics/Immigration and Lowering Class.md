Many Chinese worry that immigrating to the west results in a decrease of their socio-economic class. 

Avoiding this fate is relatively within control. 

The primary cause of lowering class is an effective reduction of your abilities. If your old position primarily involved skills like communication and making connections, then your lack of connections in the new place and lack of language fluency will reduce your abilities by a lot. If you held a position that largely required some technical skill, backed up by a recognisable qualification, then it's much harder to lose that ability. 

Steps can be taken to reduce the impact of your move. Learn the language. If your old profession is not considered valuable in the. new society, pivot to a similar one that is valued. E.g. Chinese medicine practitioner -> accupuncture. Study up to maintain your qualifications and proficiencies. 

If you already are a lower class labourer, then language is not even much of a concern anymore. You just need to be willing to carry on working hard in the new environment. It is likely that western countries pay labourers much better than in China.
