___
The percentage of people that are unemployed, among people that are either working or seeking to work. 
Along with inflation, follows the Phillips curve. (which does not account for supply shocks)

Apparently around 5% is optimal. You can never get to 0% because there are people moving between jobs. 

3 years of 25% unemployment can turn a prospering democracy into the most brutal totalitarian regime in history. (Weimar -> Nazi)
