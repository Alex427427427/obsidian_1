A theory of ethics that says ethics should be based on a set of universal axiomatic rules. 

Kantian.

### E.g.
When a person considers murder, they should ask themselves: should murder be allowed universally? If that was the case, then I'm in danger. 

In other words, do unto others what you want to be done unto you. 

### Problem
Universal rules require categories to be defined. 
"Humans should not be murdered." 

Yet it is often the categories that get revoked first when someone is about to do violence. Murder is not done to humans, but subhumans or even animals, in the eyes of Nazis. 
Since they themselves were human, they were immune to the consequences of the rule applied universally. 

How then can the deontologists come up with intrinsically good universal rules? What categories should those rules involve? 
One may appeal to the definition of entities that are capable of suffering. 

This leads to [[Utilitarianism]].
