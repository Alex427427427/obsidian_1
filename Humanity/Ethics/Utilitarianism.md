What deontologists ([[Deontology]]) often ultimately have to appeal to. 

Minimise suffering, maximise happiness. 

### Advantages
Easy to apply in a lot of arguments. 
Against the Holocaust - they only need to point to the suffering of millions of Jews that was not compensated by any comparable gain to society. 

They also have an easy time arguing against things like the persecution of gay people. While Kant came up with a deontological rule that gayness was against nature which condemns a gay man to below animal, without really justifying why gayness was against nature. 

### Problem
Humanity has not yet discovered a calculus of suffering. We don't know how much suffering points or happiness points to assign to events in the complex landscape of history. 

When suffering of alternatives are evenly matched, it becomes difficult. Consider Covid 19 lockdowns. It saved millions of lives. But it also led to misery of much more for a few months. How do we know which option would produce more overall suffering in the long run? 
### Appeals
Just as Deontologists ultimately appeal to utilitarianism, utilitarians often resort to deontological rules. 

Protect human rights. Avoid wars of aggression. 

But then what happens when you consider whether to wage a war of aggression to protect future human rights? 

### Danger
The danger of utilitarianism is that if you have a strong enough belief in a future utopia, it can become an open license to inflict terrible suffering in the present.
