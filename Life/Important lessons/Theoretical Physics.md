Academia is in a bad state right now, with broken incentives hurting everyone. The signal to noise ratio is very weak. In order to work on what I truly want to, I must first establish myself in a concrete field, and then, not let it consume me while I work on my true passion. This may not be the best for me. I will feel trapped and drained. 

If I truly believe in the topological state over aether idea, I should be able to return to it in old age. 

To make the idea survive and proliferate, is a matter of information transmission. 

With time on my hand, I could package the information in a resilient, digestible, attractive form. And I could transmit it over some channel with strong signal to noise ratio. Or at least, a channel that is wide and far reaching. 

If by then, someone else developed the idea and got recognised, then... it's all the same. Thanks to them, humanity will move forward. We need this kind of redundancy in our species - the creation and proliferation of good ideas should not depend on one person. You'd hope that humanity can generate multiple people that are each capable of arriving at the same good idea. 

Conclusion: Do NOT choose theoretical physics as a career.
