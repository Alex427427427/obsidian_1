## Street Interview
When I saw a street interview for everyone's biggest regret from ages 1 to 100, I felt sad. The 10 minute journey of 100 years makes life seem really short. 

Reaching the ages of 70 onwards, I felt sad again. Despite everyone's big dreams and aspirations, everyone ends up at the same place. Old and sitting in a chair, watching or hearing the world outside go by. What was it all for? 
## Manga
When I saw the manga "trail of blood", I wept. I wept for the mother, who was miserable and abusive due to the feeling that her life was robbed from her, and the desire for it to truly begin, and that at the end, she returned to be an old, pathetic person. I wept for the son, who was able to forgive her, taking care of her until she passed away, and that at the end, was able to live alone until old age, peacefully. I wept for both of them together, that struggled with each other and with life, until at the end there was only peace. What was it all for? 

十年树木，百年树人。

If at the end of my life, I can stand upright with dignity and respect for my own soul, maybe everything'll be okay.
