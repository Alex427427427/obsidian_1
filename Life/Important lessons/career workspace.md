### Established facts
- Do NOT go into AI (big players make the kind of contribution I want)
- Do NOT go into theoretical physics (not good career, do as passion project)
- Do NOT go straight into PhD (need overview of field)

- DO go into Masters (need overview of field)
- DO go overseas (need experience and being near good industry)
- DO remain in industry-driven field (Optical eng, photonics, RF, analog, chip)

### Why not go into condensed matter physics?
- if your moonshot unification vision of Superfluid vacuum/BEC/topological phenomena/effective gauge theories/quantum gravity analogs pans out, it won't *matter* whether you are in the field or not. 
- if it doesn't pan out, (the far more likely case), you will not be trapped in a career dead end. 
- photonics has an overlap anyway, and you can always make an effort to stay connected and return to it if you want. 

### Why go into photonics? 
- allows overlap with physics passion project
- has good employability
- interesting physics & engineering. 

**It's settled. Go into photonics.**
