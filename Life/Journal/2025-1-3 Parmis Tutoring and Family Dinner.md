Tutored Parmis. 

Dinner with her mum and dad, very friendly and cool family. 

They had Australian filmmakers Glenda and David over. 

Parmis' mum suggests studying on the side of working. Allows me to enjoy life. She really values enjoying life to the fullest, after seeing her mum die at 50, after telling her that she didn't get to live much of a life. 

Parmis' dad talked about photography.
