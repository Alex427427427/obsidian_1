Final Christmas period before graduation. Just received internship offer and handed all required docs in. 

Tutored Parmis control theory during the day. 

Went to the beach. Met Tanya and Niusha(?) who are Parmis' friends. 
Paddle boarded. Mentone beach has clean, beautiful wavey sand under the water. Looking into ocean appears stranded in Pacific. Waves were large. 

Packed up. Old creepy man followed the girls to our setup. Inserted himself to our conversation in very jarring and confrontational ways. Girls uncomfortable. He moved onto me finally, and we spoke for a long time. In the middle, he pulled out a stick and gestured and spoke of stabbing me in the heart. I didn't act intimidated but remained cross-armed and told him good for him. Eventually he left. 

Movie night afterwards organised by Jason, for all student teams. Home Alone film. 
Late night talk with Jason afterwards while walking on uni sports oval. 

I hope I get to meet Tanya and Niusha again, they were pleasant during the brief interactions we had.
