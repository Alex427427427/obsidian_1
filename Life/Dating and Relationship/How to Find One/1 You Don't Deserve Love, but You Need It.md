While humans almost universally need love (romantic) to survive, they do not outright deserve it. No one deserves love, and no one owes anyone else love. By "deserving", I mean that if you don't end up in love, it is not an act of injustice - it is only tragedy and a game failed. So **you are not justified to hate the world or the other sex** because you had failure in love. 

The reasons I put this at the start is to give you the right understanding and attitude. 
- Love is not guaranteed to find you. No righteous code of conduct demands that love shall be granted to you. 
- Yet, love is a need. Which all the more requires you to do your best at finding it, for your own happiness.
