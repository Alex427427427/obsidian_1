It is a widely known fact that someone desperate to find a partner is unlikely to succeed. It is also known that someone with low self-esteem is unlikely to succeed. 

1. For some, desperation and low self-esteem result from a lack of positive things in their lives - hobbies, friends, contributing value. 

2. For others, desperation and low self-esteem came from the long term deprivation of love itself, leading them to severely question what value they hold, and threatens to blow their sanity. But this desperation is not conductive to finding a partner. So for them it becomes a vicious cycle. Deprivation leads to low self-esteem and desperation, when they were otherwise fine in other areas of life. 

For the first group of people, it is obvious that the first steps to solving their problems is developing those other areas of life. 

For the second group of people, it is unfortunate that their situations have become this way. They are often misunderstood and labelled as belonging to the first group. They are often prescribed to develop other areas of life when those areas are already quite developed. What they need is someone to show them that they are lovable as they are, and break them out of their cycle. Unfortunately this is unlikely to happen due to the real desperation that has formed within them. So how does the cycle end? 

Wallowing in a feeling of being wronged or misunderstood is not going to help. Yes, people don't understand you, because it takes insight to see the heart of the problem. But I do. So snap out of it. The stakes are too high for you to seek emotional vindication rather than real solutions. 

What you need, is to examine which simple but important factors of love you have overlooked or are unaware of. Once identified, it is possible to change your situation in the long run.

You have nothing to lose but your loneliness. You have a life with warmth and love to win.
