**If the spaces you occupy allow repeated authentic interaction with new potential partners, it is a heaven sent opportunity. This is the single most important factor determining your success.** If you do literally nothing else in this guide, and only do this, you will likely eventually find someone that fancies you given enough time and that you're not a cunt. But, doing other things in this guide increases your chances and shortens the time by a lot. 
### Locations
Your options are work/school, volunteering, hobby classes/groups, or even online spaces like discord servers. Let's break these down. 
##### Work/School
There is a wisdom that you should not date people from work / school, because if things go badly, your experience at said work/school will be damaged all the way till either one of you leave. Don't shit where you eat, right?

There is more nuance to this though. The majority of people that became interested in me, some of which ended up dating me, were from highschool and university. There is immense power in existing in a space where you are just going about your life, and other people can repeatedly interact and learn about you without the knowledge or pressure of explicit dating. 

Don't write this option off completely. Be cautious. 
##### Volunteering
For this to work you have to be interested in the volunteering activity itself, first and foremost. The whole point of existing in spaces that allow for authentic interactions is that you are going about your life authentically. You are your natural self. You aren't disappointed that everyone at volunteering is an elderly person. You aren't disappointed that no one at volunteering is attractive to you. 

Volunteer because it adds interesting experiences to your life. Not because you want to find a partner there. Enjoy it and explore elsewhere at the same time, and let time do its thing. 
##### Hobby Classes/Groups
Drawing by yourself in your own room is not gonna help you find your partner. You ought to develop additional hobbies that involve social interaction. Cooking classes. Dance classes. Film/book clubs. 

This is better than volunteering because volunteering ultimately involves work. It can become a chore if you do not find the activity that meaningful. Hobbies on the other hand are pure fun. It makes your life more enjoyable while introducing you to potential partners. 
##### Online Communities
I don't have much understanding of these spaces. I've known people that met via gaming discord servers. I don't get the impression that the chances are high. 
### Mindset 
You must view people you meet here as potential friends first and foremost. This is very important. After there is familiarity and rapport, you can see if things can develop. 

In order to not sabotage yourself when you do decide to escalate things, there is a right way to go about the initial friend-making stage. The stage should involve playfulness and cheekiness. **Rapport** is the goal.
