##### Existing in Spaces that Allow Repeated Authentic Interaction with Potential Partners
[[7 Existing in Spaces that Allow Repeated Interaction with Potential Partners]]. 
E.g. hobby groups, work, school
This is quite a good way to meet people because it only requires you to live your life. You are not under strong time constraints to prove yourself. You are in your most natural state - which is often your best. 
##### Go out of your way to court a chance encounter
Like bars and night clubs. This is quite a difficult and in my opinion undesirable place to meet a partner. 

First of all, your window of opportunity is very short - you often have to convince someone you are a good choice within the first interaction. This means you require much more [[8 Courtship]] skills than just being in your natural state. 

There is also no other benefit to staying at a bar, like there would be in a hobby group. There is no other activity but to spend money and drink. 

It's also possible you find a waiter/waitress very attractive at a restaurant and try to rizz them. Again, your window of opportunity is too short and it's too dependent on your [[8 Courtship]] skills.
##### Friend/Family Arrangements
Picture this. You are near 30. You have failed to meet anyone up till now that you find satisfactory. You become a bit worried. Your friend agrees to help you out and set you up with a mutual friend. 

This option feels the least romantic, but in my opinion, it is very practical and actually very likely to land you in a good relationship. 

The advantages of this are numerous. 
- You begin your interaction with an explicit first date. During which there is no pretense or concealment of your intentions, only candid conversations about what you're looking for. You may even joke and lament about how you two ended up needing this arrangement, which is a tender moment. 
- When you get together, your relationship has the extra support network of the friend/friends/families that brought you together. 
- Science has shown that arranged marriages have quite a high likelihood of reporting happiness. It has been speculated that this is due to the two people's mindset. Since this is the life they've been given, the focus is not on how to escape it and maximise what could be, but rather giving their best with what they have.
