### Overcoming Anxiety
Recognise the following: anxiety arises when you worry about yourself. Are you saying / doing the right things? Are you awkward? 

This is true even if your concerns seem to be about the other person: are you making them uncomfortable? Do they find you interesting? These are ultimately concerns about YOURSELF. 

**Shift the focus from yourself to them**. Instead of worrying about whether you are saying the perfect things or showing your best side, be interested in the affairs of OTHERS. What are THEY saying to you? How do you feel about THEM? What things have been on THEIR mind? What's life like for THEM? 
### Talking
- **Be interested**
- People love to talk about themselves. **Actively listen to them and ask questions** about things you find interesting. 
- **Don't talk about things they have no reason to care about**. If you're sharing something you care about, deliver the part of the information that they would at least be able to parse. 
### What Makes Someone Annoying 
- Not recognizing signals that indicate the other person doesn't find you that interesting
- Overstaying your welcome
- Be pedantic in conversation and not willing to meet the other person who understood you 99% of the way. You correct them on tiny discrepancies that feel like the world of difference to you. 
- Showing your good qualities in a forced way. 
- Having no backbone and being unable to challenge the other person. 
- Challenging the other person for the sake of showing you have a backbone. 
### Learn Basic Facts about People
- People are capable of detecting inauthenticity from miles away. 
- People are primarily concerned with their own lives. No one owes you attention. 
- People don't learn about you by what you tell them. They learn about you by their own judgements of your whole package presented in front of their eyes.
