### The Strategy From a High Level
1. Increase your value in the market of love. [[3 What is Valuable in the Market of Love]]
2. Become good at conveying your value through the way you live, act, present, talk. 
3. Meet potential partners. The best way is to exist in spaces where potential partners can see you and interact with you in an authentic setting. 
4. Select who you want to be chosen by
5. Conduct [[7 Courtship]] appropriately so that you may be chosen 
This is not a strict order; they can all happen simultaneously. 
### Meeting Potential Partners
There are three main approaches.
##### Existing in Spaces that Allow Repeated Authentic Interaction with Potential Partners
[[6 Existing in Spaces that Allow Repeated Interaction with Potential Partners]]. 
E.g. hobby groups, work, school
This is quite a good way to meet people because it only requires you to live your life. You are not under strong time constraints to prove yourself. You are in your most natural state - which is often your best. 
##### Go out of your way to court a chance encounter
Like bars and night clubs. This is quite a difficult and in my opinion undesirable place to meet a partner. 

First of all, your window of opportunity is very short - you often have to convince someone you are a good choice within the first interaction. This means you require much more [[7 Courtship]] skills than just being in your natural state. 

There is also no other benefit to staying at a bar, like there would be in a hobby group. There is no other activity but to spend money and drink. 

It's also possible you find a waiter/waitress very attractive at a restaurant and try to rizz them. Again, your window of opportunity is too short and it's too dependent on your [[7 Courtship]] skills.
##### Friend/Family Arrangements
Picture this. You are near 30. You have failed to meet anyone up till now that you find satisfactory. You become a bit worried. Your friend agrees to help you out and set you up with a mutual friend. 

This option feels the least romantic, but in my opinion, it is very practical and actually very likely to land you in a good relationship. 

The advantages of this are numerous. 
- You begin your interaction with an explicit first date. During which there is no pretense or concealment of your intentions, only candid conversations about what you're looking for. You may even joke and lament about how you two ended up needing this arrangement, which is a tender moment. 
- When you get together, your relationship has the extra support network of the friend/friends/families that brought you together. 
- Science has shown that arranged marriages have quite a high likelihood of reporting happiness. It has been speculated that this is due to the two people's mindset. Since this is the life they've been given, the focus is not on how to escape it and maximise what could be, but rather giving their best with what they have. 
### Who Should You Choose
This comes back to [[3 What is Valuable in the Market of Love]]. 

**You need to consider whether the other person is searching for the kinds of experiences and feelings you are interested in providing.** **You also need to consider whether the other person can provide you the kinds of experiences and feelings you desire.** If someone just wants to fuck around and you want a lifelong best friend, you needn't consider them anymore. 
##### Someone is interested in me - a very rare event - but I'm not that interested in them. Do I choose them?
If someone is interested in you you have basically won - it doesn't take that much to reach a relationship, so this question is no longer a question of landing in a relationship, but **what makes a good relationship.** 

It is almost guaranteed that if you go into a relationship out of **fear** that this is the only chance you have to experience love, and not out of desire for the other person, your relationship will become a chore quickly. There is a higher risk of you cheating. There is a higher risk of you looking at other couples and feeling jealous. There is a higher risk of you feeling regret that you weren't able to find someone you liked. Overall not a good experience, and disrespectful to the other person, because they deserve someone that likes them. 

This brings us to a point of strategy: **choose a partner out of desire, not fear**. Too often we forget this guiding principle. 
### How to be attractive to those you want to be chosen by
I quote from [[3 What is Valuable in the Market of Love]]: " ...When people window shop a partner in the market of love, they are shopping for the potential to have **good experiences / memories / feelings**, be it companionship, sex, fun activities, emotional support, a feeling of total acceptance, a lifelong journey... ...Notice how the search of good virtues is the least on someone's mind. Instead, people **rapidly evaluate your vibe and make judgements on what kinds of experiences and feelings you can provide them.** That is the basis of attraction."

**You need to tell the story of who you are** through the way you present yourself and act. What good is your value in the market of love if there is no way for other people to identify it? 
##### Dress
The way you dress should reflect the vibe you want to convey. Are you sophisticated? Are you carefree? Are you athletic? Are you artsy? 
##### Body
The way you look needs to reflect the values you hold. It is almost universally attractive if you are physically fit, clean, healthy. Consider skincare. Consider exercise. 
##### Living
The way you live needs to reflect the values you hold. Do you want to be interesting? Fill you time with interesting activities. Do you value friendship and laughter? Catch up with friends. Do you value cleanliness? Clean your room. **People learn about you by seeing how you live, not by what you tell them.** 
##### Courtship ([[7 Courtship]])
You need to know how to rizz when the situation requires. 
##### Social Skills ([[Social Knowledge]])
You need to obtain a basic degree of social skills so that you are not annoying or unpleasant to be around. 
### Misc Facts
1. You cannot force a relationship. You cannot convince someone you're worth it. You can only attract. 
2. People can smell inauthenticity from miles away. Don't do shit like forcefully dropping in your virtues during conversation. 
3. People are primarily concerned with their own lives. No one owes you attention.
