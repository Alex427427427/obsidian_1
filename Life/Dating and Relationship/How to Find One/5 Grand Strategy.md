| Strategy                     | Hobby groups, work/school, frequent a store of some kind, online communities. Starts with friends first and involves moderate amount of [[8 Courtship]] when you want to escalate. The rest very much follows the "match +1" matching energy and escalation cycle.  | Speak to a stranger at a bar or nightclub. If chemistry is there, something may happen. Pretty much 100% [[8 Courtship]].                                                                                                                                                                                                | Have a family or friend introduce someone. Meet for a date and see if you want to go ahead. Involves minimal [[8 Courtship]] though performing some is always nice for the both of you.                                                                                   | Download and use a dating app. Try to make a nice profile with photos that tell an interesting story. If matched, text to build rapport and maybe attraction. Arrange dates and see where it goes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Who Should You Choose
This comes back to [[3 What is Valuable in the Market of Love]]. 

**You need to consider whether the other person is searching for the kinds of experiences and feelings you are interested in providing.** **You also need to consider whether the other person can provide you the kinds of experiences and feelings you desire.** If someone just wants to fuck around and you want a lifelong best friend, you needn't consider them anymore. 
##### Someone is interested in me - a very rare event - but I'm not that interested in them. Do I choose them?
If someone is interested in you, you have basically won - it doesn't take that much to reach a relationship, so this question is no longer a question of landing in a relationship, but **what makes a good relationship.** 

It is almost guaranteed that if you go into a relationship out of **fear** that this is the only chance you have to experience love, and not out of desire for the other person, your relationship will become a chore quickly. There is a higher risk of you cheating. There is a higher risk of you looking at other couples and feeling jealous. There is a higher risk of you feeling regret that you weren't able to find someone you liked. Overall not a good experience, and disrespectful to the other person, because they deserve someone that likes them. 

This brings us to a point of strategy: **choose a partner out of desire, not fear**. Too often we forget this guiding principle. 
### How to be attractive to those you want to be chosen by
I quote from [[3 What is Valuable in the Market of Love]]: " ...When people window shop a partner in the market of love, they are shopping for the potential to have **good experiences / memories / feelings**, be it companionship, sex, fun activities, emotional support, a feeling of total acceptance, a lifelong journey... ...Notice how the search of good virtues is the least on someone's mind. Instead, people **rapidly evaluate your vibe and make judgements on what kinds of experiences and feelings you can provide them.** That is the basis of attraction."

**You need to tell the story of who you are** through the way you present yourself and act. What good is your value in the market of love if there is no way for other people to identify it? 
##### Dress
The way you dress should reflect the vibe you want to convey. Are you sophisticated? Are you carefree? Are you athletic? Are you artsy? 
##### Body
The way you look needs to reflect the values you hold. It is almost universally attractive if you are physically fit, clean, healthy. Consider skincare. Consider exercise. 
##### Living
The way you live needs to reflect the values you hold. Do you want to be interesting? Fill you time with interesting activities. Do you value friendship and laughter? Catch up with friends. Do you value cleanliness? Clean your room. **People learn about you by seeing how you live, not by what you tell them.** 
##### Courtship ([[8 Courtship]])
You need to know how to rizz when the situation requires. 
##### Social Skills ([[Social Knowledge]])
You need to obtain a basic degree of social skills so that you are not annoying or unpleasant to be around. 
### Misc Facts
1. You cannot force a relationship. You cannot convince someone you're worth it. You can only attract. 
2. People can smell inauthenticity from miles away. Don't do shit like forcefully dropping in your virtues during conversation. 
3. People are primarily concerned with their own lives. No one owes you attention.
