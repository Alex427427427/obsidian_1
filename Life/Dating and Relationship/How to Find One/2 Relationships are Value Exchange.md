At their core, **relationships exist for value exchange**. This is not a statement of cynicism, but an important perspective to understand the dynamics of love. 

Some people think viewing relationships as value exchange means you abandon someone at the first sight of boredom or unhappiness or conflict or when a better option comes along. But the person in this scenario can be perfectly understood to be bad through the lens of value exchange. The person that leaves at the first sight of those things contains a poor display of value - who would want to be with someone that behaved that way? They would provide very little value in the form of security or comfort. So ponder this. What values do you provide? Are you a pleasant and fun person to be around? Are you a reliable and understanding person who can provide comforting emotional support? Are you an intelligent and mature person who can provide a sense of security for the other person that you won't abandon them when someone "better" comes along?
