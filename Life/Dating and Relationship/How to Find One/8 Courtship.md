### The Match +1 Escalation Cycle
The "Match +1" escalation cycle is something developed for autistic people, but is illuminating for everyone to understand. 

On a high level, closeness is measured in steps from acquaintances to best friends / lovers, each step with the associated behaviours and conversation topics, and both of you begin at step 1. To escalate, you initiate a conversation or action that raises to the next step. Then you detect reciprocation. If reciprocation firmly arrives, you are now safely at the higher step. If reciprocation does not arrive, you fall back to the original step. Wait for a while, and try to escalate again. 

This strategy protects you from acting severely out of line at any stage, while providing a structured way to escalate. 
### Progression: Acquaintances at Regular Space to Friends to Lovers
Perform the Match +1 cycle to go from acquaintances to friends, but with additional rapport and flirtiness with plausible deniability. If this flirty aspect is too lacking, it can make the attempted escalation to next stages feel unnatural. 

By this point, you should already be hanging out as friends. 

By the time you decide you have feelings for them, tastefully suggest hanging out at a more intimate setting (like a genuine date somewhere) with no expectation of them accepting it. 

When you both start going on dates, it's only a matter of building more and more attraction by tastefully displaying / hinting your admiration for them. 

At some point you ask them out properly with a conversation, at a nice location. Be candid, lay out what you think about them and that you wish to be in a committed relationship with them. 
### Progression: Arranged Dates to Lovers

### Progression: Chance Meeting to Lovers
Like at a bar or nightclub. Got no fucking clue mate. I don't want to try this. 
### Flirting 
Escalation of suggestive behaviours couched in plausible deniability. 

Put practically, if someone is doing something to engage you that feels extra (lots of touching, looking at you in a way that feels a bit too long, or doing a lot of poking fun and complimenting you), then that might be flirting or it might not. That's the whole point. Plausible deniability. They can safely disengage at any time. 

If you want to know if someone is flirting, you need to test it. You do that by escalating things, but just a bit, so that now **you** have plausible deniability (touch them back in a comfortable way, maintain eye contact, or joke-compliment them back). If they escalate back and continue to do so as you escalate in turn, that is flirting. Eventually one of you will break cover and do something with clear intent (a kiss, an approach + ask for a number, or straight up telling them what you think of them and that you're interested). Otherwise, if you escalate and they don't change their behaviour or they back off, then they wer probably just being friendly and you should take the hint and do the same. 
### Wit
You need it. I don't know how to understand this further. I don't know how someone gains wit...
### Eye Contact
Be able to look at them in the eyes like a friend. It shows you acknowledge them and are interested in what they have to say. 

Don't dart your eyes away all the time.
Don't stare intensely at them. 

Don't do PUA shit and stare them down hungrily or anything like that. 
### Self Deprecations are Absolute No Go
It is not really funny, nor humble, it's just pathetic and awkward.
