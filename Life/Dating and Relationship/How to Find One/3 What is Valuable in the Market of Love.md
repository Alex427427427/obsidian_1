Prerequisites: [[2 Relationships are Value Exchange]]
___
Your value in the value exchange of relationships is not the same thing as your positive qualities. For example, you may be good at studying or drawing. **What good is that to your partner** in the relationship? A person that is studious may indicate hard working nature. A person with an impressive hobby may indicate they are capable of sitting by themselves and independently derive joy in life without relying solely on you. But those are indications and nothing more. Don't think that being talented means you are valuable in the dating pool. 

When people window shop a partner in the market of love, they are shopping for the potential to have **good experiences / memories**. So your primary value in relationships is your ability to give good experiences / memories in life. Qualities like having a fun personal life, being open minded to new experiences, being attractive, being socially intelligent, being wise to life's problems, all are very good indications of the value you'll provide in a relationship. 

Know that this value is ultimately subjective, though there are common metrics. 

### Common Measures of Value
- **social wisdom** - how aware are you of social signals? How nice does it feel to interact directly with you?
- **fun / interesting life** - how fun or interesting is it to hang around you? Is being around you likely to lead to fun / interesting experiences?
- **appearance** - how do you look? How do you dress? How healthy do you look? What does looking at you make them feel? 
- **competence** - how good are you at what you do? 
- **virtues** - are you an honest, responsible person? Are you a sincere person? Are you likely to run from problems? Are you loyal? 
- **emotional wisdom** - how aware are you of the quality and causes of your emotions? How do you handle them? How aware are you of the quality and causes of other people's emotions? How do you handle them? Do you know when and when not to give advice, versus provide support?
- **life wisdom** - how good are you at understanding the true nature of someone else's problems? How good are the advices you're likely to give?
