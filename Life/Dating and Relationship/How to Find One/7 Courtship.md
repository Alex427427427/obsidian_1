### Flirting
Escalation of suggestive behaviours couched in plausible deniability. 

Put practically, if someone is doing something to engage you that feels extra (lots of touching, looking at you in a way that feels a bit too long, or doing a lot of poking fun and complimenting you), then that might be flirting or it might not. That's the whole point. Plausible deniability. They can safely disengage at any time. 

If you want to know if someone is flirting, you need to test it. You do that by escalating things, but just a bit, so that now **you** have plausible deniability (touch them back in a comfortable way, maintain eye contact, or joke-compliment them back). If they escalate back and continue to do so as you escalate in turn, that is flirting. Eventually one of you will break cover and do something with clear intent (a kiss, an approach + ask for a number, or straight up telling them what you think of them and that you're interested). Otherwise, if you escalate and they don't change their behaviour or they back off, then they wer probably just being friendly and you should take the hint and do the same. 
### Wit
You need it. I don't know how to understand this further. I don't know how someone gains wit...
### Eye Contact
Be able to look at them in the eyes like a friend. It shows you acknowledge them and are interested in what they have to say. 

Don't dart your eyes away all the time.
Don't stare intensely at them. 

Don't do PUA shit and stare them down hungrily or anything like that. 
### Self Deprecations are Absolute No Go
It is not really funny, nor humble, it's just pathetic and awkward.
