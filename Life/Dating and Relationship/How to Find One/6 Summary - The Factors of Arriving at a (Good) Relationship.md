___
(24 year old male) Note taker's understanding as of 2025-1-11. 

It's not much more than ticking a list of checkboxes, and let time and chance do its thing. 
### Absolutely Non-negotiable Basics
- Maintain cleanliness. Body and clothing. 
- Develop other important areas of life - competence in a line of work; hobbies; friendships/support network. 
### Social Knowledge - Talking
- **Shift the focus from yourself to them**. Instead of worrying about whether you are saying the perfect things or showing your best side, be interested in the affairs of OTHERS. What are THEY saying to you? What things have been on THEIR mind? What's life like for THEM? 
- People love to talk about themselves. **Actively listen to them and ask questions** about things you find interesting. 
- **Don't talk about things they have no reason to care about**. If you're sharing something you care about, deliver the part of the information that they would at least be able to parse. 
### Social Knowledge - What Makes Someone Annoying 
- Not recognizing signals that indicate the other person doesn't find you that interesting
- Overstaying your welcome
- Be pedantic in conversation and not willing to meet the other person who understood you 99% of the way. You correct them on tiny discrepancies that feel like the world of difference to you. 
- Showing your good qualities in a forced way. 
### Learn Basic Facts about People
- People are capable of detecting inauthenticity from miles away. Be authentic. 
- People are primarily concerned with their own lives. No one owes you attention.

Doing other things in this document increases your chances and shortens the time by a lot.
