### Technologies
Whatever interacts with the Layer 1 "wire". **NICs (Network Interface Cards)** [[NIC]]. Wifi access cards. 
**Switches** ([[8 Switches]]) allow data to be sent between specific devices (NICs), so are layer 2. 
**Routers** ([[9 Routers]]) have one NIC per network interface. Note that routers themselves do not constitute layer 2 technology, even though the NICs within them do. 

The Layer 2 ecosystem controls the "hop to hop" of data. Where data hops from one NIC to the next. 
### Protocols
purpose is to deliver data from NIC to NIC. 
##### MAC Address (Media Access Control) [[MAC Addresses]]
48 bits, represented as 12 hex digits. 
Identifies a NIC. 

So MAC addresses come with the **NIC**.
