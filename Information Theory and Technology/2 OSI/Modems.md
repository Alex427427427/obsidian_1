They modulate and demodulate electrical signals onto the medium of long distance transport. See [[Modulation Schemes Grand Summary]] [[Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)]]

Within a network, signal can be digital on wires. But when a network connects to the rest of the internet via a long cable network, the signal must be converted into an RF modulated form. So a modem is often required to sit between a router ([[9 Routers]]) and the rest of the [[10 Internet]].
