A terminal program. 

It allows running commands on a remote device. 

Can be used to log into a switch [[8 Switches]] and router [[9 Routers]].

Developed before the internet, security not really an issue. 

Sends all data in PLAIN TEXT. Anyone can see my username and password when I use it to log into that remote device. 

Never use this on today's internet.
