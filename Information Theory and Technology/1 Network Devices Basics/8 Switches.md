Prerequisites: [[7 Bridges]] [[6 Hubs]]
___
Like a combination of hubs and bridges. 
They are like hubs in the sense that many devices can connect to it. 
They are like bridges in the sense that they can learn which hosts are connected to each port. 

Switches can learn on a per port basis. 

Traffic doesn't flow on ports that are irrelevant to the communication. 
### Def
Switches facilitate communication **within a network**. Now, we can redefine a network as that which is connected by a switch. 
### Other Details
A network shares the same IP address space. That corresponds to the switch that lies at the nexus of the network. E.g. 192.168.1.x

### Other perspectives
Basically a smart wire. It is invisible to the hosts. But it does the work of connecting hosts with the same wire. 

**For switches in action in detail, see [[2 Everything that a Switch Does]] during data transmission.**
