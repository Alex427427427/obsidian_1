Allows automatic sharing of data. In the past, transfer of data had to be done with disks that were transported by people.

##### Example
At home, there is printer, computers, phones. They require similar connectivity.

These two locations are grouped into two separate networks. 
Also in schools, they have their own networks. 
Within a school, there may also be networks within networks - a network for each classroom. They are **subnets**. [[12 Subnets and Masks]]

### Internet
Ultimately, these separate networks might connect with each other. 
Instead of weaving all nodes in all networks into one giant network, the networks are connected as units on the internet. It is just a bunch of company networks connecting to a bunch of home networks connecting to a bunch of school networks. Of course, ISPs (Internet Service Providers) usually exist somewhere to control access to the internet.
