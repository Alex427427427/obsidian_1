Imagine a long wire connecting two computers in a large room.
The signal decays over that distance. (An extension of [[12 Dispersion of EM Waves]], where the medium is the wire and the speed of each frequency is determined by a different refractive index. See [[Transmission Lines]])

In this case, we need a repeater. Its sole purpose is to regenerate a signal at stronger power. It is essentially an amplifier.
