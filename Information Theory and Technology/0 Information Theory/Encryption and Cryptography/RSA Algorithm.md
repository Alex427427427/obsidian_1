(Not to be confused with SHA-256 ([[SHA-256]]), which is a cryptographic hash function that doesn't use keys and is irreversible, whose main purpose is not for communication but simply data integrity.)
### The Story
A way to perform asymmetric encryption. See [[Encryption]].
The name comes from the initials of three people that came up with it. 

To deduce the private key from the public ket, it requires large number factorisation into 2 large co-primes (only shared common factor is 1), which is impossible for present supercomputers to do in a good portion of the lifetime of the universe. 

### The Mechanism
To be filled. 
##### Encryption

##### Decryption

##### Key Generation
