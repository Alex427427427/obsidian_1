### Purpose
Prevents unauthorised incoming traffic to a private network. 

This is what makes devices inaccessible to everyone else on the internet (except direct communications with services)

### Basic Working
A program that filters incoming messages according to a list of rules stored in a table called "**Access Control List**". The rules could restrict IP addresses, ports, protocols, keywords, domain names... Entries are "Allow" or "Deny". 
Determined by the network administrator. 
There are rules both for incoming and outgoing traffic. 

### Types
##### Host Based Firewall
Protects one host. 
software downloaded on hosts. 
A lot of antivirus softwares will have in built host based firewalls. 
##### Network Based Firewall
Protects all devices in the network. 
Has a hardware and software component. 
Can be implemented in the router [[9 Routers]]. **Most routers come with a built in firewall**.
Can be a standalone device. 
Can even be in the cloud! (wtf how does that work? Guess the cloud service just needs to intercept all incoming traffic somehow before sending to the network again.)
