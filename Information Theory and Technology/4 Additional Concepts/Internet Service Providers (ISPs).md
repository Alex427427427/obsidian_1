In principle, you only need a modem and a router that's configured properly with an available IP address in order to connect to the internet. 
This is true for giant servers like google.com. Those directly connect to the internet. 

For regular people though, we must connect to the internet through a middle-man - the Internet Service Provider (ISP). This is because those "in principle" tasks are amazingly complex. 

ISPs:
- Provide us a router (configured properly), a modem
- Own regions of cables
- maintain hardware infrastructure around neighbourhoods, like [[Street Cabinets]]. 
- allocate us an IP address
- Holds agreements with other service providers so that we can enjoy access to those services via our ISP.
