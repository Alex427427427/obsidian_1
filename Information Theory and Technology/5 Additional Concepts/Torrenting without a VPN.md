### Why it's Slow
A VPN service routes all your network to some remote place, and you're sharing it with a lot of people. The routing to remote place increases latency, and the sharing network results in lower bandwidth. 

That said, you should still do it with a VPN for security / privacy reasons as outlined in [[VPN (Virtual Private Network)]].
