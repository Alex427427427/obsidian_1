Yet to be filled. 

Apparently most service providers like google are AS. 

There is an ASN (Autonomous System Number). Dunno how that fits into the internet picture. 

A lot of this is dealt on the level of ISPs. ([[Internet Service Providers (ISPs)]]). 

It is said that all services on the internet are an interconnected series of autonomous systems. 

There is also mention of level 3, I don't know what that means.
