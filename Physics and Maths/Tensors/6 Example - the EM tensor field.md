The electromagnetic field strength tensor field is a rotation [[Generator]] field emanating from current sources, experienced by other sources. It exists at every location in spacetime. It is antisymmetric, expected of an infinitesimal rotation tensor. Expressed in natural units where the magnetic field is scaled up by a factor of $c$:
$$F=\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -E_x & -E_y & -E_z \\
E_x & 0 & -B_z & B_y \\
E_y & B_z & 0 & -B_x \\
E_z & -B_y & B_x & 0 
\end{bmatrix}$$
What does this rotation generator field rotate? The 4-velocity ([[3 Relativistic Motion]]) of charged objects. The equation of motion is simply the lie algebraic equation for infinitesimal rotation:
$$\frac{dU}{dt}=\frac{q}{m}FU$$
The term $qFU$ is clearly a force. So the tensor may also be understood as a **function** that maps velocities to forces, in the context of electromagnetism.
