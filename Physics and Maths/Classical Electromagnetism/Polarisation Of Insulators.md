This note is relevant to non-conductive materials embedded in an external electric field.
## Non Conductive Materials - Dielectrics
A non-conductive material is macroscopically neutral, but is in fact made of positive and negative microscopic charges. These charges are not free to move. If any foreign charge wanders into the material, they are free to move about the material. These are called "free charges". 

To a person studying electromagnetism, the most important property of such materials is their ability to be polarised to have two apparent electrical poles - that's why they are called "**dielectrics**".
## Polarisation
Indeed, for a non-conductive material, the internal arrangement of the material is constrained such that no native constituent is free to move about the lattice. They can, however, move ever so slightly away from their original location, still tightly bound to one another. This is what happens to the material when placed in an electric field. 

The field drags the positive charges in one direction, and negative charges in the other, separating them, creating many microscopic dipoles throughout the material. Alternatively, the field orients existing dipoles to align in the same diretion after internal drag.

Notice that the internal bound charges will still cancel to neutral, but there is now a thin layer of naked surface charge distribution on either side of the material.
