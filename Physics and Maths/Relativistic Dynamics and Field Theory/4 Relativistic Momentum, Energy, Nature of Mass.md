## 4-Momentum
The property responsible for inertia, $m$, controls the curvature imparted onto worldlines by some force. Multiplying it to 4-velocity, gives the 4-momentum. 
$$P=mU=\gamma m(c,v_x,v_y,v_z)^T$$
The same notes about 4-velocity carry over, except with an additional factor of $m$. All objects have a momentum through spacetime of length $mc$.
## Energy
In all dynamics, momentum is the [[Generator]] of spatial translation, while energy is the generator of time evolution. We now have a notion of momentum over spacetime. 4-momentum is the generator of spacetime translation. By inspecting the 4-momentum, we see that $\gamma mc$ is the generator for $ct$ translation. Generator variables and the resulting translation variable have a reciprocal relationship. Therefore, the generator for $t$ translation is $\gamma mc^2$. This is the total energy of the object.  
$$\boxed{E=\gamma mc^2}$$
With this knowledge, we can rewrite the momentum:
$$\boxed{P=\left(\frac{E}{c},p_x,p_y,p_z\right)^T}$$
where $p_i=\gamma mv_i$.
### Rest Energy
When an object is not moving, $\gamma=1$, therefore $E_0=mc^2$. This is Einstein's famous mass-energy relationship. Mass, a measure of $E_0$, is that stationary energy which travels upwards through time. 
## The General Energy-Momentum Relation

Let $p=\sqrt{p_x^2+p_y^2+p_z^2}$. Using the Minkowski norm and facts derived above, we know that 
$$P_\mu P^\mu=\left(\frac{E}{c}\right)^2-p^2=(mc)^2$$
$$\boxed{\therefore E^2=(mc^2)^2+(pc)^2}$$
This relationship is only valid for isolated systems in free space, in the absence of potential energy. Does increasing the total energy with potential energy increase the rate of time translation?
## Massless Objects
The above analysis decouples momentum from mass. Massless things can still have momentum, because momentum was never intrinsically linked to mass - it remains the generator of spatial translation. 
$$p=\frac{E}{c}$$
This implies that their motion through space and motion through time occur at the same rate, because the generators are the same value. Thus their apparent velocity through space is $c$. This also implies that they have a 4-momentum length of 0, which matches the fact that they have no mass. 

Now let's turn our attention to a few major differences between a massive object travelling through space approaching the speed of light, and a massless particle. 
1. One can always lorentz transform into the frame of a massive particle travelling close to the speed of light such that it becomes stationary. The massless particle remains unreachable, travelling at the speed of light. 
2. The massive particle travelling close to the speed of light, experiences time passing, and is moving through space and time at a near infinite rate, with respect to their own time passing. The massless particle has a 4 momentum of length 0, and does not move over spacetime. Instead, its existence is static over spacetime. It is its entire worldline, puncturing all of spacetime at 45 degrees.
