Quantum experiments only ever probe massive ensemble of particles and probe the average of their behaviour. Quantum formalism then assigns this group observation to each of the individual particles. This forces us to adopt local non-realism, which has severe problems when integrating with the locally real GR. 

What if the quantum effects are only ever present when there is a large ensemble? This forces us to adopt non-local realism. Perhaps there is some emergent phenomenon of the particles establishing non-local connections with one another when they are close, undergoing apparent superluminal information exchange via these non-local connections. (ER=EPR) Entanglement could then be explained by this process. Perhaps, the connections themselves give rise to properties of spacetime. Perhaps the locally real GR is accepting of apparent non-local connections if they are wormholes. 

The utmost important thing to do is to study, study, and study. I am incapable of investigating this until I fully understand the existing theories and develop the mature mathematical skills. I will return to this.
