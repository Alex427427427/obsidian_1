As introduced in [[1 The Quantum State]]:
1. Every measurable property of the system is characterised by a linear operator $\hat A$ - a matrix. When measured, the quantum state of the system probabilistically snaps into one of the **eigenvectors** of $\hat A$, called **eigenstates**. The **eigenvalue** is the value of the measured property. 
2. The probability of $\ket \Psi$ becoming each eigenstate is distributed according to the square magnitude of the projection of $\ket\Psi$ onto every eigenstate. 

So measurement events cause two things to happen:
1. The quantum state $\ket\Psi$ is probabilistically projected onto one of the eigenstates of the operator $\hat A$ associated with the measurement. 
2. The operator $\hat A$ is applied to the projected state, which spits out the same state multiplied by the measured quantity.
