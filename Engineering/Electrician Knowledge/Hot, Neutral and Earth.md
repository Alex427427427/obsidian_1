## Definitions
##### Hot, also known as Live, or Active
The non-earth potential line.
##### Neutral
The earth potential line that pairs with hot to form a closed loop. 
##### Earth, also colloquially called Ground

## Colours
In Australia: 
1. Hot = brown (in other places, can be red or black)
2. Neutral = blue (in other places, white or grey)
3. Earth = yellow or green (in other places, also green, but also bare metal)
## Plugs
Australian plugs have 3 ports to carry these 3 signals. 
1. Top left slanted = hot
2. Top right slanted = neutral
3. Bottom vertical strip = earth
The slants are 30 degrees.
