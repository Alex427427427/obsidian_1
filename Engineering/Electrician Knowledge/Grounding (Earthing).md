An isolated circuit can have any absolute electric potential level. This is true even across the 2 windings of a transformer - transformers only ensure a relationship of voltage, not absolute potential. This can be dangerous if there is a large potential difference between the input and output windings of a transformer. 

Additionally, isolated appliances may exist at any absolute potential (which corresponds to some absolute charge level). If too high, it will readily discharge onto a person upon contact. 

For the above reasons, it is best to have every appliance on earth connected to a common circuit ground - the earth, which has such capacitance it may as well be considered a near ideal conductor. (This will vary depending on the moisture of the soil, and how readily ions are to conduct through the soil.)

Household appliances usually have metallic casings that are connected to earth via a third wire. For this reason, there are 3 holes in an Australian household plug. 
## Circuit Ground and Earth
"Circuit ground" is the reference potential in a circuit, which may be at any absolute level. Earth is the specific potential of the earth. Usually these are the same.
