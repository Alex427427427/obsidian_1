___
A special case of RFI. Any large loop formed by a circuit will pick up noise from changing magnetic flux through it. When 2 devices whose circuit grounds are connected, which each again are earthed at 2 far locations, a loop is formed by the connected ground and the earth. This is a single conductor with a giant loop in the middle, making it very prone to picking up changing magnetic flux through it, adding noise to the circuit. 

Removing one of the earthing points will remove the loop, and the noise.
