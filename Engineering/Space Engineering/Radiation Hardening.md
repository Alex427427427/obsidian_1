Cosmic rays are high energy charged nuclei or elementary particles. 

They collide with transistors and knock off its charge carriers or damage its geometry. 

The smaller the transistor, the more likely the collision will be damaging enough to change it in an information processing context. A small enough transistor can be destroyed by a single cosmic nucleus. 

Electronics that are resistant to cosmic radiation are called "radiation hardened".

To prevent this, a simple way is to enlarge the transistors. Make them into battleships instead of sports cars. They are less affected by individual cosmic events, but they are larger and move with more energy requirement and change their state slower. Usually the slower speed is inconsequential in space applications. 

There may be other internal circuitry for monitoring the whole device, but that can get pretty complicated.
