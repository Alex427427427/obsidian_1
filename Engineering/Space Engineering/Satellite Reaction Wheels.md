A flywheel attached to a satellite. 

Finely controls the orientation of the satellite by changing the rate of rotation of the flywheel. If 3 are attached, one on each axis, total control is granted for the orientation in space. 

### Bearings
Used to wear out a lot, until recently. We've begun to use ceramic bearings instead of metal ones. Ceramic ones don't require lubricant and are immune to static electricity surface pitting. 
(Surface pitting is a type of corrosion that forms small holes in a surface, usually made of metal. In bearings, can be caused by static electricity discharge, removing material from the surface.)

The downside to ceramic bearings is their cost. A lot of the steps in its manufacturing are more difficult. It is also newer tech meaning there wasn't time to make it cheap like metal ones.
