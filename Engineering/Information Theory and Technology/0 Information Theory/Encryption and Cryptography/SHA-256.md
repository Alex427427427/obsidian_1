Not to be confused with [[RSA Algorithm]], which is an algorithm implementing asymmetric encryption.

This is a cryptographic hash function. 
### Purpose
Verification. Data integrity.
### Working
Input: raw data
Output: a 256 bit long string of bits.

**It is impossible to reverse this function.** Given the output, cannot feasibly deduce the input no matter what. It is also impossible to guess an input that would produce the same output. 

**There are no keys**, further contrasting it from RSA, where the existence of private keys allows for the reversal of the data scrambling. 
### Example Use
A service has a database storing user passwords. These passwords, upon creation, are immediately put through the hash function, and then stored as those outputs. 

So the database is a database of hashes. This is so that if the data is leaked, people couldn't find out what the original passwords are. 

Only when a user enters the correct password, the service side will pass it through a hash function and compare with the hash stored in their database, and it matches, can the user gain access to the service.
