A cell tower is a physical tower capable of sending and receiving radio signals for mobile phones with coverage on the order of kms or 10s of kms. 

They form a network called the cellular network. Exists as a separate entity to the internet ([[10 Internet]]). But ends up being connected at various points thanks to VOIP ([[Voice over IP (VOIP)]]).

Facilitates phone calls. Can also facilitate regular internet usage. Requires entry point from the cellular network into the internet. 

The towers are usually connected via other means, like fibre optic cables.
