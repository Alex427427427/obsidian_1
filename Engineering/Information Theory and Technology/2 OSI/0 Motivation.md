The purpose of networking is to allow hosts to share data with one another. 

To share data, hosts must follow a set of rules, no different to language.

The rules of networking are divided into 7 layers, known as the Open System Interconnect (OSI) model. 

Like a human body, with a skeletal, muscular, cardiovascular, digestive, system, the OSI model's layers each serve a specific function. If all layers operate, the goal of networking is accomplished. 

The goal of this folder is to understand the purpose of each layer, how they contribute to the overall goal of networking, which is the sharing of data between two hosts.
