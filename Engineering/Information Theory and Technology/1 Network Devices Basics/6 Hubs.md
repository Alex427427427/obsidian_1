### Motivation
Imagine having to connect 5 devices directly. There needs to be a "handshake problem" number of wires connecting all of them. For an n-device network, adding a new device requires n additional wires. This is simply not scalable. 

### Hubs
Instead, have all devices in a network physically connect to a central hub. 
Very easy to scale. 

A hub is nothing more than a multi-port repeater. [[5 Repeaters]]
All it does is regenerate a signal, and send onto all ports.
