A host needs 4 thing configured as stated in [[0 Everything a Host needs Configured]]. So why is it that every time I go to a coffee shop, I don't need any configuration to connect to the internet using the shop wifi?

### DHCP
This protocol allows a DHCP server to provide an IP ([[3 IP Addresses]]), Subnet MAsk ([[12 Subnets and Masks]]), Default Gateway ([[9 Routers]] IP), DNS IP [[Domain Name Service (DNS)]], to any hosts that connect to the network. 

When my device connects to a network, it sends a "discover" message to a DHCP server, and the DHCP server replies "Offer" along with the 4 information to my device. 

The DHCP often lives in a router.
