After the rest of this folder, it will be clear that, in order to achieve internet connectivity, a host needs 4 things:
1. Host's own IP address ([[3 IP Addresses]])
2. The subnet mask ([[12 Subnets and Masks]]) of the host's subnet
3. The router's ([[9 Routers]]) IP as the default gateway
4. The DNS ([[Domain Name Service (DNS)]]) IP address.
