A file distribution method where individuals around the world that have the file send specific portions of the file to the person that requests it. This is decentralised. The distributors are called "seeders" and the requesting person is called a "leech". It is a community etiquette to become a seeder after leeching, for some amount of time to help distribute the file to any others that want it. When a person leeches and does not become a seeder, it is called a "hit and run". 

As of 2025, the most common way to do this is to download qbittorrent, and visit thepiratebay.org to grab the metadata of the file you want, which will be sent to the qbittorrent application and begin the torrenting. 

Often it is against the law. 

It is advisable to conduct this using a [[VPN (Virtual Private Network)]] so people can't see your IP.
