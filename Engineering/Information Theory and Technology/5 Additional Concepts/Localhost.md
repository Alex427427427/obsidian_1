Devices can make requests to themselves. To do this, they send the requests to an IP address ([[3 IP Addresses]]) representing themselves, in the context of networks. This is not just the IP of the device, because there is a special IP reserved for this purpose that allows "loopback" traffic efficiently. 

This IP is called the localhost. Its address range:
127.0.0.0/8
See ([[12 Subnets and Masks]]) for how to interpret this IP.
