___
A network of proxy servers ([[Proxy]]) maintained in a decentralised manner. 

Any traffic is routed through 3 proxies in the TOR network. Any one node only knows the IP of the previous node and the next. 

Only when all 3 nodes are compromised will the client and service link be identifiable. This is unlikely because usually the proxy servers span nations. 

Has triple encryption. The client has 3 layers of encryption, each one breakable by exactly one of the proxy servers.
