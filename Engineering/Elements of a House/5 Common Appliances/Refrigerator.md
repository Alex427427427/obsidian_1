### Working Principle
Just the [[Refrigeration Cycle]].

The actual process in today's fridges are slightly different, involving evaporation and condensation in the cycle. 
### Components
##### Refrigerant
The lifeblood of the refrigerator. It starts in the form of a gas, then a liquid, then a gas as it cycles through the refrigerator's parts. 
Through a series of discoveries and refinement, today we use a compound called HFC 134a. 
##### Compressor
A motor powers the compressor which increases the temperature and pressure of the gaseous refrigerant and sends it off to the condenser. 
Typically found along the bottom of the refrigerator. 
##### Condenser
Where the refrigerant naturally cools down and liquifies. The hot vapours coming from the compressor are cooled down here. Usually large copper coils, found along the bottom or back of the fridge. 
##### Expansion Valve or Capillary Tube
The refrigerant is sent to the expansion valve - a thin set of copper tubes. This is a forced expansion and cooling, lowering the temperature and pressure dramatically. About half of the refrigerant evaporates here due to the drop in pressure. 
##### Evaporator
Where the cooling process ends, taking the remaining refrigerant liquid and turns it back into a vapour. Here the refrigerant soaks in more heat from the location of desired cooling.
