___
Weather protection and insulation at the top of the house. Can be pitched (angled) or flat.

Not to be confused with the [[Framing]], which has a component that lies beneath the roof to provide structural support. 

### Types
##### Shingles
Cheapest but lasts the least, but still enough (say 20 years). Why pay for the roof of the next 10 owners of the house? Shingles are incredibly popular in America, but not so in Australia. I like these the most. They look so clean and light compared to tiles. Mostly made of asphalt.

##### Tiles
Costs anywhere around 4 - 30x more than shingles and lasts anywhere around 2 - 15x as long.

##### Metal
Lasts for a ridiculous amount of time (up to centuries??) but very expensive and most of the time looks like shit.

### Flashing
A sheet of material that can be inserted at the seams of the roof to prevent water and debris from entering the roof system.
