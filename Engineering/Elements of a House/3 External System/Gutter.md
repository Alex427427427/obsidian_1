### Prerequisite
The house's walls and foundations are prone to mould and rot, which are caused by dampness. Mould and rot damage the structural integrity of the house, which in the worst case can lead to straight up collapse. 

When it rains, the entire area of the roof receives rain water. Without anything else, this water flows to the edges of the roof and falls down onto the ground near the walls. This is a lot of water to be falling near the walls. 
### Gutter Function
The gutter is a metal channel running along the roof edges, exposed to the sky, which collects all the rain water that fell onto the roof and ran towards the roof edges. The water then flows along the roof edge, redirected into a single location, usually a water tank or a **downspout** - a pipe that runs down the wall from the gutter's exist, redirecting water to somewhere else on the ground. 
### Gutter Must be Cleared of Leaves Periodically
If leaves accumulate in the gutter, the channel loses its ability to redirect water. Imagine it was filled to the brim with leaves. Water could just overflow and run over the leaves and fall right off the edge of the roof. 

So for the sake of the structural integrity of the house's walls and foundations, it is necessary to clear the gutters of leaves.
