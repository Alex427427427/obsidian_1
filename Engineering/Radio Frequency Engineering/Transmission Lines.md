A transmission line is like an optical medium for high frequency EM signals. It has an effective permittivity, permeability, conductivity, and thus a refractive index. 

When resistances mismatch, the signals may transmit or reflect. There is no refraction. 

The speed of each frequency is also different. This is like dispersion. This causes the signal to become distorted over distance. 

The Telegrapher's equation describes all required phenomena. It is easily derived from a differential element model of the transmission line, with a capacitance, inductance and resistance per unit length.
