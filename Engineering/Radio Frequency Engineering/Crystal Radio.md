Earliest and simplest radio receiver designs, amazingly uses no external power, but only the energy contained in the received EM waves. Very quiet, requires a headset to hear, an audio signal AM modulated onto the carrier frequency, in real time. 

The impinging EM waves ([[Electromagnetic Waves]]) cause current to be conducted in the crystal only in one direction, resulting in an automatic rectification. Originally only works for AM waves but FM modules have been created. Now its function is replaced by diodes.
