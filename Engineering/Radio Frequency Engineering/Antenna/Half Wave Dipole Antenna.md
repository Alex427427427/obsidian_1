## Definition
A dipole antenna whose length is half the wavelength of the RF radiation. 
## Why
The voltage signal actually travels through copper at near speed of light. This means that the signal at the RF frequency can be thought of as not only radiating through space away from the antenna, but **also travelling along the length of the antenna**, reflecting off of each end, and travelling back. Since the lines terminate, this an open ended resonator.

The fundamental resonant frequency occurs at a wavelength twice the length of such a vibrating object. This is the frequency at which no power is wasted within the antenna. 
## Power Transfer
The current and voltage signals are 90 degrees out of phase, meaning there is no real power being dissipated in the antenna. 
## Shape
The notion that RF energy also propagates along the length of the antenna means that to get this ideal resonating characteristic, the shape of the antenna doesn't matter - only the total distance if a signal is to travel along it.
