Decibel Milliwatt (dBm) is a logarithmic unit of measuring power in the radio frequency context. Its definition is most easily remembered as:
1. $1mW=0dBm$
2. Multiplying power by a factor of 10 adds 10 to the dBm value. 

Alternatively, the explicit formula is: 
$$\boxed{P_{dBm}=10\log_{10}(P_{mW})}$$
