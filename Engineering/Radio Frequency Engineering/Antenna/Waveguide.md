## Definition
A device that facilitates EM wave propagation with minimal loss, until the other end of the device. 
## Construction
RF waveguides are usually a hollow metallic cavity. EM waves reflect off of the sides due to being unable to penetrate the boundary.

Alternatively, dielectric media can be used, to facilitate total internal reflection. This becomes the optical fibre in the optical frequency range.
