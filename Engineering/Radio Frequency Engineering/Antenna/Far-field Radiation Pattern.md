The far field radiation pattern is the directional gain of the antenna. 

This pattern is the Fourier Transform of the aperture distribution. This is derived in Fourier Optics. 

A consequence of the above statement is that if the aperture distribution is not gaussian, there will be sidelobes in the radiation pattern - imagine the simple case of a sharp cut off of the aperture distribution, therefore giving the radiation pattern a sinc-like pattern, with many lobes. 

For exact derivation of the Far field condition: $z > 2D^2/\lambda$, see [[Fourier Optics - Convolution View]].
