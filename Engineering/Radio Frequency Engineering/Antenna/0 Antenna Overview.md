## Description
Any distribution of current or charge that varies in time will radiate electromagnetic energy. Some are more efficient than others by taking advantage of resonance. Some have more directivity than others, Some radiation patterns look different to others. An antenna is a system that spatially arranges the variation of charge and current over time, in efficient ways and to produce desired radiation patterns. 
## Radiation Pattern
Radiation pattern is the angular distribution of relative power over the isotropic sphere pattern. 
## Considerations
The primary consideration for efficiency and radiation patterns is geometry. The efficiency for a fixed geometry is frequency dependent. 
##### Common examples
[[Half Wave Dipole Antenna]]
[[Magnetron]]
[[Patch Antenna and Microstrip Antenna]]
## Aiding Components
Lenses, mirrors, waveguides, apertures, can all further reshape the radiation pattern. 
## Aperture
An angular distribution that captures the same information as the radiation pattern. The aperture function is the fourier transform of the far field radiation pattern. See [[Fourier Optics - Wavelet Derivation]].
