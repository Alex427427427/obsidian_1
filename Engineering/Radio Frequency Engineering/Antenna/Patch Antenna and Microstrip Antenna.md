## Description
A type of antenna with low flat profile, a metallic patch printed on a dielectric surface. The other side of the surface has a large metallic plane called a ground plane. Multiple small patches together for beamforming and steering with high gain, is called a **microstrip antenna**. The size makes these antennae ideal for microwave frequencies.

## Radiation Mechanism
Fringing fields at the edges. Need to look more into it.
