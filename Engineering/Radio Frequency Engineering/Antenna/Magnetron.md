A special antenna invented in WW2, capable of generating high frequency, and powerful waves. 

Involves a metal with cavity, with a central cathode that emits electrons with high voltage applied. The whole arrangement is in a strong magnetic field.

When electrons get emitted and reach the anode case via cyclotron motion, they repel the surface charges of the spokes they visit. Any such effect at one spoke instantaneously induces alternating charges across the entire anode.

The electric field between neighbouring spokes are like the fields stored by a capacitor. The current generated between the spokes are like the source of magnetic field of an inductor. This arrangement has a natural resonant frequency. Additionally, the electrons being emitted get funneled by these fields into a spiral pattern.

The spoke wheel and the resonating anode both rotate, producing a powerful EM radiation.
