A network in the context of RF engineering is a collection of connected circuit blocks that process RF information. Each network element can have any number of ports. A port is a pair of signal carrying wires. RF energy can enter, reflect, absorb, transmit to and from these elements. 

Network Elements have input and output impedances. 

These sound just like regular analog circuit analysis, with cascading blocks that each have input and output impedances. I suppose RF networks are just such networks in the context of high frequency signals. 

RF energy propagates through an RF network much like EM waves propagate through optical elements.
