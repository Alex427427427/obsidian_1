When RF energy impinges on an input port of an RF block in an RF network, energy may be reflected out of the same port, or appear at the other ports. This process looks like a scattering. Indeed, RF energy propagates through an RF network much like how an EM wave propagates through an optical system. One may even argue they are fundamentally exactly the same process. 

A discrete number of parameters can fully describe this scattering behaviour of an RF block. In general, the reflected, transmitted components relate proportionally to the input energy by a complex number - a scaling which is usually weakening, and phase shift. A tensor ([[Tensors]]) can summarise this information. 

The diagonal entries, $s_{ii}$, represent the reflection coefficients of RF energy incident upon port $i$.
