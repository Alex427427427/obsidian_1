Superheterodyne receivers operate with one additional step to what is in principle necessary - the conversion of incoming RF signal to a specific intermediate frequency (IF) via frequency mixing with a local oscillator (LO). All the amplification and filtering can then be done to the IF signal. We want this because amplifiers have frequency dependent behaviour. It is much easier to have a tunable LO, than to have a tunable amplifier or filter.
