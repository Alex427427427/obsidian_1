In analog modulation schemes, a carrier wave can be modulated by its magnitude and angle: 
$$y(t)=A(t)\cos(2\pi f_c t+\phi(t))$$
The deviation of $A(t)$ from a constant then, corresponds to Amplitude Modulation ([[Amplitude Modulation (AM) and Demodulation]]). The deviation of $\phi(t)$ from a constant corresponds to **angle modulation**, which can be further split into 2 types. If the instantaneous phase velocity is changed, then that is **frequency modulation** ([[Frequency Modulation (FM) and Demodulation]]). If the instantaneous phase itself is changed, then that is **phase modulation**. 

While AM and FM have clean looking waveforms given a sinusoidal signal, PM looks much stranger:

In the above diagram, red is carrier, blue is signal, green is the modulated signal.
