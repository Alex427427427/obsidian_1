The primary way of implementing amplitude modulation. **Multiplies 2 signals in time domain, convolves 2 signals in frequency domain**. Usually one of the inputs is the signal carrying information, often called "RF (Radio Frequency)", the other a pure oscillation, often called "LO (Local Oscillator)". It is usually denoted with a circle encasing a multiply sign on a diagram. The process of multiplying an input signal with an oscillation to create a frequency shifted signal is called **heterodyning**.
