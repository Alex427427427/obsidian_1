## Definition
An oscillator whose resonant frequency is controlled by an input voltage. 
## How to Make One
First understand [[Oscillators]]. Notice that oscillators involve some form of frequency dependent circuit, whether as feedback or relaxation. 

We just need to replace any of those frequency-determining elements with elements where the previous frequency determining characteristic varies with voltage. 

For example, the C in an LC resonator or RC relaxer can be made to vary with voltage, using any **reverse biased PN junction** - perhaps you need to learn about semiconductor physics, but those junctions invariably have a voltage dependent capacitance.
