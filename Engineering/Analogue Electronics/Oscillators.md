## Fundamental Need
In many applications like clocks and radios, we need a circuit that, when powered simply, produces an oscillating signal. This signal may or may not be sinusoidal. 
## From a Control Theory Perspective
In an abstract control theory perspective, an oscillator is an amplifier given positive feedback.
