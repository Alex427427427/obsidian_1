##### Project Title
Smart Antenna Beamforming and physical layer development for remote sensing
##### Why have you selected the project? A short motivational description
I wish to enter high frequency IC research in the future, like photonics or THz IC, so RF engineering is a necessary stepping stone. I have spent my degree chasing electromagnetics, reading textbooks during holiday, to learn about this incredibly beautiful field of physics and wide phenomenology that touches almost everything else. Unfortunately I hadn't had the opportunity to put any of it into practice. I want to do that. I want to learn about CMOS, MEMS and various RF subsystems. I want to develop proficiency in using simulation software, and physical testing. Beamforming antennae seems like a very nice and compact project to allow me to do all of that. You also seem like a very experienced expert in the field with multiple textbooks and countless PhD graduates, which is very reassuring, and I hope to learn a lot from you. 
##### What did you know already about this project? A short description of your strength
1. **Electromagnetics**: microscopic and macroscopic formulations, retarding potential formulation, frequency domain formulation, and relativistic formulation of electromagnetic theory. Radiation sources and far field patterns, spherical harmonics, phased arrays. Boundary conditions of EM waves at medium boundary; behaviour of EM waves during propagation through lossless, lossy, isotropic and anisotropic media; polarisation, scattering, interference, along with various optical phenomena; geometric optics. 
2. **wireless communications**: basic modulation schemes such as QAAM; basic information theory; frequency domain analysis; analog and digital filtering methods. 
3. **control, PCB design, embedded system**: designed electrical system for nova rover. Implemented Field Oriented Control using a DSPIC for a fully custom brushless motor driver PCB. 
4. **programming and robotics**: proficient in python, C/C++. Conducted Summer Research Project in reinforcement learning. Implemented Hybrid A* algorithm for autonomous car in MCAV. Implemented SLAM and YOLO for an autonomous robot that can recognise fruits. 
##### Software packages are known such as (CST Microwave Studio, Keysight Advanced Design System (ADS) and/or Systemvue, Altium, Matlab)
Used Altium to design fully custom 3-phase motor driver, and a hardware communication translation unit.
