An abstract entity containing a lot of data. More specifically, we often look at a database that is a **collection of tables which have relationships**. Called **Relational Databases**. They are the most popular. 

Physical implementation could be paperwork in drawers, information stored in servers, cloud based, excel spreadsheets, etc.

Look at any major website - Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn - all of them are powered by databases, tracking number of customers, how many times a button is clicked, all sorts of information. 
For them, there is too much data to be stored in Excel, but the databases they use function very similarly to Excel. 

### Elements
Tables with:
Columns headings ("fields")
Rows ("records")

Records between tables are often related (like pointers, just by virtue of the entry contents). E.g. records in one table may have fields like "3" in the field of "customer", which links that record to records in the customer database, namely customer 3.
