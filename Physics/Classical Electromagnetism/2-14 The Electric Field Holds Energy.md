The capacitor is so useful that it keeps giving new insights into the properties of the electric field. By examining the nice uniform field pattern of the capacitor, we can deduce that the electric field holds energy density, and exactly how much it holds. 
## Where is Energy Stored in the Capacitor?
Consider a charged and uncharged capacitor. In each case, there is no moving entity. There is no kinetic energy. All the energy is potential. Where is this energy? In the electric field filling the space between the capacitor plates. 
## Energy Stored in the Electric Field
Capacitors store energy $U$:
$$U=\frac{1}{2}CV^2=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\epsilon A}{d}|\vec E|^2d^2=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon Ad |\vec E|^2$$
There is also a uniform volume of electric field in the space between the plates. We simply need to divide $U$ by the volume to obtain the energy density $e$, which must directly depend on the electric field, even locally, because it is **the only non-zero local variable** that changed when the capacitor had no energy, compared to when it did. 
$$\boxed{e=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon|\vec E|^2}$$
We see that the **energy density is proportional to the square magnitude of the electric field**. In free space:
$$\boxed{e=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0|\vec E|^2}$$
Which, in [[3 Natural Units]]: 
$$e=\frac{1}{2}|\vec E|^2$$
Notice that the electric field holds **more energy when in a polarised medium**. This is not because the electric field itself takes on different physical properties in the new medium, but an artefact of us accounting for extra energy stored in the microscopic dipoles, using the electric field. 
## Energy Transfer from Field to Charge
Now consider a point charge moving through the uniform electric field. It picks up energy, gaining speed. This energy must have come from the infinitesimal volumes of electric field that it passed through. The external source then quickly replenishes energy into those locations that the charge passed through. Electric fields, when passing through charged particles, deliver energy to them if able to. 

Now consider if the point charge was held still. The point charge is surrounded by a near infinite potential, produced by whatever is holding it still. Since it is unable to gain energy, the electric field is unable to give it energy. 

Now consider the background is moving. This is similar to a continuous energy source passing through the charge. There is a field that holds energy passing through the charge, yet the charge cannot be broken out of the holding potential. No matter for how long, the energy does not accumulate on the charge, because energy can not be delivered at any stage of the process. Does this sound familiar to another process? See [[Speculation]].
