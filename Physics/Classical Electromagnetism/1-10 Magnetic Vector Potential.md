Magnetic fields do no work, because they only ever result in an orthogonal force to moving charges. Yet, it is still useful to define a magnetic potential, the main reasons will be apparent when we move to relativity. 

The potential must produce the magnetic field via a first order derivative. It cannot be a gradient operation (which would suggest the magnetic potential is a scalar and is irrotaional.) The only remaining operator is the curl. 
$$\boxed{\vec B=\nabla\times\vec A}$$
Gauss' Law for magnetism, that magnetic fields are divergenceless, directly imply the above equation via Helmholtz's decomposition theorem - a geometric statement about the calculus of fields in space. 
## Interpretation
The magnetic vector potential $\vec A$ is a vector quantity that represents the influence of a current $\vec J$ propagating over space. It's almost as if the current "drags" the space around it to flow forward with it, and the different flow layers cause a rotational field that is its curl. It scales with inverse proportionality, like the electric potential.
