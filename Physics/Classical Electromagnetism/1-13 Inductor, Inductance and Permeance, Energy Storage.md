A current loop produces a magnet dipole field. A long helical current - equivalent to many current loops stacked together - creates a nice uniform magnetic field pattern within the cylinder of space in the middle of the helix, while the field outside nearly cancels out everywhere. This configuration of current is an inductor.

## Inductance
It's clear that the more current there is, the more
