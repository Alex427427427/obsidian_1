From [[3 Improving Capacitance with Polarisable Medium]], we know that the electric field holds energy. Is this not static energy? Does this not result in mass? 

As the source of the electric field accelerates, there is magnetic field. This is extra kinetic energy. Could we recover the mass energy relationship by only considering the field surrounding charge? Try this. 

For the total mass to not diverge, the singularity at the center of the field source must be avoided. Perhaps the center of the field source is a hole of some sort. 

A simple calculation of the total energy stored in the electric field around an electron gives the minimum radius of the electron to be equal to half of the classical electron radius. $r=\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 E}$, where $E$ is the rest energy of the electron. My field calculation yields $r=\frac{e^2}{8\pi\epsilon_0 E}$. This is the lowest bound of the electron size, because any smaller, the surrounding electric field contains enough energy to exceed the known mass of the electron. If I assume a uniform smearing of the electron charge over a sphere, then my answer would be the same as the classical electron radius. 

To peer into the structure of electrons and other subatomic particles, keep an eye out for beta decay and the weak and strong force.
