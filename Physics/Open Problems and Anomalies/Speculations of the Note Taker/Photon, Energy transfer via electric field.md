## Energy Transfer from Field to Charge
Consider a point charge moving through the uniform electric field. It picks up energy, gaining speed. This energy must have come from the infinitesimal volumes of electric field that it passed through. The external source then quickly replenishes energy into those locations that the charge passed through. Electric fields, when passing through charged particles, deliver energy to them if able to. 

Now consider if the point charge was held still. The point charge is surrounded by a near infinite potential, produced by whatever is holding it still. Since it is unable to gain energy, the electric field is unable to give it energy. 

Now consider the background is moving. This is similar to an electromagnetic wave passing through the charge. There is a field that holds energy passing through the charge, yet the charge cannot be broken out of the holding potential. No matter for how long, the energy does not accumulate, because energy can not be delivered at any stage of the process. Could this explain the photo electric effect in an equivalent way to Einstein's view? Could this shed light on the nature of photons?
