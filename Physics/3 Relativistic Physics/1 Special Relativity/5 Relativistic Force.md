Newton's second law in relativity:
$$\frac{dP^\mu}{d\tau}=F^\mu\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \implies\ \ \ \ \\ \ \ \ \ \ m\frac{dU^\mu}{d\tau}=F^\mu$$
The spatial part of the force, in the stationary observer frame, has a simple form when the universe is constrained to one dimension of space along the direction of the force and acceleration:
$$\vec F=\frac{d}{dt}(\gamma m\vec v)=\gamma^3m\vec a$$
What about in general?

Force is that which causes acceleration of massive objects through space. Its result, acceleration, is the same as an infinitesimal lorentz boost - **[[hyperbolic rotation]] of the 4-velocity away from the time axis**. This invites me to define a rotation [[Generator]] antisymmetric tensor $A$ such that:
$$AU=\frac{F}{m}\ \ \ \ \ \\ \ and \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \frac{dU}{d\tau}=AU$$
However, the full details have not been worked out and this idea remains a [[Speculation]] by me.
