Tags: [[Speculation]] [[1 Electric Polarisation and the Polarisation Field]]
___
Polarisation makes two neutral objects always attract despite the attraction is completely electromagnetic, which should be symmetric in attraction and repulsion. Had this been the end of the story, polarisation might have been the greatest candidate to explain gravity as an emergent phenomenon. Unfortunately, polarisation does not lead to 3 or more objects all attracting one another, and should also be a very chaotic process. 

But could the chaos disappear on large enough scales? 

Less likely to succeed compared to recasting EM dynamics as a spacetime curvature. 

John Oppenheim believes gravity is classical and has a stochasticity. He and his students proved that any theory coupling classical and quantum degrees of freedom must be stochastic.
