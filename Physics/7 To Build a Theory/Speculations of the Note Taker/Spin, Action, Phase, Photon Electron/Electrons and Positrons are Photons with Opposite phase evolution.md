Solving the Maxwell wave equations, there are travelling wave solutions, but we discard 2 of the 4. They are indistinguishable from the 4, but whose phase evolve backwards. 

Electrons and positrons are also entities whose phase evolve in opposite directions through time. Photons' phase evolution direction is determined along their direction of travel through spacetime, in a hypothetical frame. Electrons and positrons have their phase evolution directions determined along time. 

This further supports the theory that electrons are photons forced to be stationary. In that process we must seek an explanation of why the photon's phase evolves by a half cycle for every complete orbit. Seek mass shell's square root and the dirac equation.
