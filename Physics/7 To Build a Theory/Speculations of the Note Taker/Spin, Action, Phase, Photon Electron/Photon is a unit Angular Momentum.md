___
The energy and momentum equations for the photon show that the photon is always arranged in such a way that its angular momentum is constant. 

Its rate of action is constant. 


Explains why angular momentum is quantised. 

In order to explain spin, it must be fundamentally tied to the fact that an entity is forced to be stationary and can be lorentz transformed over spacetime. 


Can an electron with up spin spontaneously release a photon and convert into its opposite orientation? Angular momentum is conserved, but is momentum? Is energy?
