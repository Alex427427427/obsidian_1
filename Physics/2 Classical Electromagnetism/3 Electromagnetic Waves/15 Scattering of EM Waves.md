This material is valid when the objects that the EM waves are scattering off of is small compared to the wavelength of the incident waves. 

Imagine a plane wave happening upon a point charge. The charge's motion will be sinusoidal and happen at the same frequency as the incident wave. This motion causes a dipole radiation. EM energy flows in all directions out of this charge. This energy is taken away from the incident wave. Thus EM energy has been scattered. This is **Rayleigh scattering**.
