The angular laws of reflection and refraction is best mechanistically understood as the conservation of phase transport. Phase transport can always be broken into two components, one parallel to the media interface, one perpendicular. 
## Reflection
Consider the portion of the incident waves that are reflected. Consider the parallel and perpendicular components of phase transport. The parallel component must be the same velocity, because nothing has impeded the phase transport in that direction. The perpendicular component must also be the same velocity, because the medium is the same, thus the rate of phase transport in that medium should be the same too. For this reason, upon considering the vector of phase velocity, the incident angles and the reflected angle must be the same. 
$$\boxed{\theta_i=\theta_r}$$
## Refraction 
Now consider the portion of the incident wave that is transmitted. The parallel component of phase transport must occur at the same velocity. The perpendicular component of phase transport must occur at velocities related by the refractive indices. Thus, the wavefronts must be squashed in that perpendicular direction. This makes the direction of propagation appear to shift towards the normal axis. By doing some simple geometry, we find that: 
$$\boxed{\frac{\sin(\theta_2)}{\sin(\theta_1)}=\frac{v_2}{v_1}=\frac{n_1}{n_2}}$$
The above law is called "Snell's law". Upon rearranging we find that for the same wave happening upon a cascade of media boundary, this quantity is constant:
$$\boxed{n_i\sin(\theta_i)=const}$$
## Total Internal Reflection
When light travels from a high refractive index medium to a low refractive index medium, there exists an incident angle beyond which all energy is reflected back into the incident medium. This is the critical angle and is that angle which produces a transmitted angle of 90 degrees. 

The intuition behind this lies in the defining properties of refractive index - permittivity of the medium i.e. polarisability i.e. capacitivity of the medium. To go from a high refractive index medium to a low one, is to go from a medium with low spring constant to high spring constant. In a sense, a softer medium to a more rigid medium in the optical sense.
