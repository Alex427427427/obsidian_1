This property of EM waves is moreso due to the wave properties rather than specific properties of Electromagnetism. 

**Huygen's principle** describes every infinitesimal point in a medium as a spherical radiator of EM energy. These spherical wavefronts interfere to form flat macroscopic wavefronts. The nature of such a mechanism means waves always want to disperse. When passing around an obstruction, the wavefront will bend outwards. This is diffraction. 

This effect is dependent on the relative size of the obstruction or gap, and the wavelength. If the wavelength is small relative to the obstruction or gap, then a long array of small antennae. They beamform to have a majorly frontal wave propagation. However if the wavelength is large, there is less beamforming effect and the wave propagates more radially. 

A single slit may have an interference pattern as a result of this diffraction. Due to the sharp cutoff of the radiating aperture, and the radiation pattern being the fourier transform of the aperture distribution, the radiation pattern on a detector screen is naturally one with side lobes.

This is an **interference pattern**. With different aperture distributions, the pattern will look different. Above is a small round aperture. Below are a square aperture and a double slit aperture.

The Fourier Transform relationship between the pattern and the aperture is the explanation of why the pattern looks like the square of a sinc function given abrupt slits.
