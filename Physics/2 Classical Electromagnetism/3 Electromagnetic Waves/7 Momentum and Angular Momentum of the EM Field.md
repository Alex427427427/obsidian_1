Consider a plane wave washing over a charge in free space. Whenever the electric field pushes the charge in one direction, the magnetic field acts on that velocity to product a force in the same direction of the wave propagation. This happens regardless of the electric field orientation. Over time, the charge obtains momentum. Let's consider this. 
## Derivation of Linear Momentum Transfer Rate
Assume a unit charge is stationary at $t=0$. $F_\perp$ is the force transverse to wave propagation, $F_\parallel$ is the force parallel to wave propagation. Using the lorentz force law, we have: 
$$F_{\parallel}(t)=v_\perp(t)B(t)q=v_\perp(t)\frac{E(t)}{c}q=v_\perp(t)\frac{F_\perp(t)}{c}=\frac{P}{c}$$
Where $P$ is the power delivering to the charge. We need not continue to obtain an explicit expression for the momentum, but simply recognise that both sides involve a time rate of change: 
$$\frac{dp}{dt}=\frac{1}{c}\frac{dE}{dt}$$
Thus: 
$$\boxed{p=\frac{E}{c}}$$
So the momentum density of the electromagnetic wave is its energy density divided by $c$. 
## Angular Momentum
A circularly polarised EM wave causes a charge to orbit the axis of incidence. The circularly polarised EM wave therefore must carry angular momentum. The classical treatment is far more complex than the quantum treatment, so we shall revisit this point during particle physics.
