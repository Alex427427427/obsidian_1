Dispersion is a residual effect of the greater phenomenon of refraction. 

The angle of refraction depends on the refractive index, which in turn depends on the permittivity of the medium. 

If the permittivity is frequency dependent, then the refractive index too will be frequency dependent. Therein lies the mechanism for an incoming beam of multi-harmonic light to split into slight diverging directions of propagation for each frequency. 

Usually, permittivity increases with frequency - think the frequency properties of a capacitor. thus the refractive index increases with frequency. This means that light at the blue end of the spectrum will bend more than light at the red end of the spectrum.
