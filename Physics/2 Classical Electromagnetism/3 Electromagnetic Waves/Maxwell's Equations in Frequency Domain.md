We define yet another set of maxwell's equations for the time harmonic quantities in frequency domain, in order to deal with wave propagation in lossy media. The equations become amazingly simple. 
## Derivation
In the frequency domain, the fields at every point in space are oscillating with some angular frequency $\omega$. The time differential operator simply becomes a multiplication:
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\rightarrow i\omega$$
So the equations become:
$$\nabla\cdot\vec D=\rho_f$$
$$\nabla\cdot\vec B=0$$
$$\boxed{\nabla\times\vec E=-i\omega\vec B}$$
$$\boxed{\nabla\times\vec H=\vec J_f+i\omega\vec D}$$
