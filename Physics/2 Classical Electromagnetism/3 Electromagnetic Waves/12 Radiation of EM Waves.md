## Radiation Sources
A harmonically varying current results in a harmonically varying magnetic field. Since a harmonically varying current must have an accompanying harmonically varying charge distribution (changing dipole), there will be an accompanying harmonically varying electric field. 

This spherically propagating field decays only by $1/r$, and corresponds to a power density decay by $1/r^2$.
