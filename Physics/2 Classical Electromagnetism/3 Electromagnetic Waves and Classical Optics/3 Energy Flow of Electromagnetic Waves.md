## Energy Density in General
The electric field holds energy density $e$. [[20 The Electric Field Holds Energy Density]] It holds it with magnitude
$$e=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0|\vec E|^2$$
The magnetic field holds energy density. [[21 The Magnetic Field Holds Energy Density]]. It holts it with magnitude
$$e=\frac{1}{2\mu_0}|\vec B|^2$$
Therefore the total energy held at a location in space that contains both fields is: 
$$\boxed{e=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0 |\vec E|^2+\frac{1}{2\mu_0}|\vec B|^2}$$
## Energy Density in a Wave
Since the magnetic component can be directly related to the electric components in an electromagnetic wave, where $|\vec B|=|\vec E|/c$ thus $|\vec B|^2=\mu_0\epsilon_0|\vec E|^2$. Thus, the total energy density (the PROPAGATING COMPONENT OF...) is:
$$\boxed{e=\epsilon_0|\vec E|^2}$$
The orthogonality of electric and magnetic vector components leads to a generalisation that must hold for general field configurations. The orthogonal components create the propagating energy density, while the total fields hold the total energy. This means that for a given $\vec E$ and $\vec B$, the propagating energy density vector $\vec S$ is:
$$\vec S=\vec E\times\vec B$$
