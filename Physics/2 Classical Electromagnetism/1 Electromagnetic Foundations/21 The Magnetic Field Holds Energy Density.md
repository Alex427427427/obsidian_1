By examining the nice uniform field pattern of the inductor, we can deduce that the magnetic field holds energy density, and exactly how much it holds. For this, we will consider an inductor that does not use windings, but a single current sheet. 
## Energy Stored in the Magnetic Field
Inductors store energy $E_k$:
$$E_k=\frac{1}{2}LI^2=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\mu_0 A}{l}\frac{|\vec B|^2l^2}{\mu_0^2}=\frac{1}{2\mu_0} Al |\vec B|^2$$
Where we invoked Ampere's law that $I=\frac{Bl}{\mu_0}$.

There is also a uniform volume of magnetic field in the space between the plates. We simply need to divide $E_k$ by the volume to obtain the energy density $u$, which must directly depend on the magnetic field, even locally, because it is **the only non-zero local variable** that changed from when the inductor had no energy. 
$$\boxed{u=\frac{1}{2\mu_0}|\vec B|^2}$$
We see that the **energy density is proportional to the square magnitude of the magnetic field**. 

In [[3 Natural Units]]: 
$$u=\frac{1}{2}|\vec B|^2$$
