Faraday found a completely new phenomenon. When magnetic flux through a loop changes in time, an electromotive force happens in the loop. It turns out that electric fields can in fact have a non conservative component. The negative sign comes from defining their relative orientation with the right hand rule. If the negative sign was absent, this would lead to a runaway process of ever higher magnetic flux and ever higher currents, which would be ridiculous. 
## Integral Form
$$\boxed{\oint_C\vec E\cdot d\vec l=-\frac{\partial\Phi_B}{\partial t}}$$
where $\Phi_B=\int_S\vec B\cdot d\vec A$ is the magnetic flux through the surface $S$ enclosed by the loop $C$. The magnetic field can also be called the magnetic flux density. 
## Local Form
Reduce the area dimension with stoke's theorem, converting the electric field circulation to local vorticity, and the magnetic flux to the magnetic flux density:
$$\boxed{\nabla\times\vec E=-\frac{\partial\vec B}{\partial t}}$$
