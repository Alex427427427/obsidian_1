## Charge
Charge is the property of matter that causes a certain type of repulsion and attraction, separate to gravity. Certain things were discovered to attract and repel. A collection of such behaviour had been compared and analysed, leading to the most simple explanation: 
**Charges come in two varieties, call them positive and negative. Like charges repel, opposite charges attract. The amount of charge is proportional to the strength of attraction and repulsion. When positive and negative charges coexist, their effects cancel out macroscopically.** The attraction and repulsion is called electrostatic. 

The quantity of charge is usually labelled $Q$. The sign of $Q$ reveals the variety of charge. 
## Current
Charges move away from objects with the same net charge and towards objects with the opposite net charge. When charges flow, there is a current. Current is technically a variable associated with some imaginary plane. The rate of charge flowing through the plane is the current. We denote current usually with the letter "i". Thus:
$$I=\frac{dQ}{dt}$$
##### There can be a current flow even if the net charge is 0. 
We now know that all matter is made of equal parts positive and negative charges. The positive charges are stationary, locked in their position in the material lattice. The negative charges move about freely in the material. If the negative charges move, then there is a current flowing past imaginary planes even though from the outside, the material appears to have no charge. 
##### Charges flowing to the left is equivalent to the opposite charges flowing to the right
They result in the same physical properties and behaviour, so are indistinguishable currents. 
##### An Emergent Phenomenon of Forces between Currents
We began our study by the phenomenon of repulsion and attraction between stationary charged objects. But people later found that parallel currents also attract and repel one another, even though the net charges are 0. The strength of the attraction and repulsion depends on the current. If the currents point in the same direction, they attract; else, they repel. This must be a new phenomenon, separate from electrostatic attraction and repulsion. 
## Units
We need a unit against which charge and current are measured. Historically, the unit for current was first defined, to be the **Ampere** (A) - the amount of current carried in 2 parallel wires separated by 1 meter that would result in a force of $2\times 10^{-17} N$ per meter of length of the wire. Then the unit for charge was defined with dimensional analysis, multiplying 1 Ampere with 1 second, to give the **Coulomb** (C). 

There was speculation in the past that charge was a continuous fluid. Now we know that it is made of infinitesimally small units. The negative variety is an **electron** with a charge of $-1.6\times10^{-19}C$, because it is the one typically free to move in a material, and conduct electricity. The positive variety is a **proton** with a charge of $+1.6\times10^{-19}C$. Within modern experimental precisions, these two charges are equal in magnitude. Usually, electrons orbit proton-filled cores to form atoms, in equal amounts such that the net charge is neutral. The assembly of atoms make up all matter. 
## Current Density 
The same current can be flowing through a region of any cross sectional area. We can also talk about the density of this current over the area. This is the current density $\vec J$, pointing in the direction of current flow. For a surface $S$ composed of infinitesimal area elements with area $dA$, the relationship between the current and current density is:
$$I=\int_S\vec J\cdot d\vec A$$
So integrating the current density over an area gives the total current. 

Further simple dimensional analysis yields
$$\boxed{\vec J=\rho\vec v}$$
Which says that current density is the product of charge density and velocity.
