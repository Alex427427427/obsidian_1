## Inductance Parameters
The inductance is:
$$L=N^2\frac{\mu_0A}{l}$$
This means that 3 dimensional properties improve the inductance:
1. Increase winding number $N$
2. Increase cross sectional area $A$
3. Decrease length $l$
## Further Improvement with Magnetisable Medium
The parameter $\mu_0$ is a property of vacuum. It can actually be improved if we substitute vacuum with a different medium. If the medium more readily conducts magnetic field lines through it for the same applied current, then it has a higher permeance and hence permeability - the dimensionally reduced permeance. 

The improved inductance is 
$$L=N^2\frac{\mu A}{l}$$
where $\mu$ is the general permeability of the medium. 

Ferromagnets, having a high permeability, are favourable for this task.
