This note is relevant to non-conductive materials embedded in an external electric field.
## Non Conductive Materials - Dielectrics
A non-conductive material is macroscopically neutral, but is in fact made of positive and negative microscopic charges. These charges are not free to move. If any foreign charge wanders into the material, they are free to move about the material. These are called "free charges". 

To a person studying electromagnetism, the most important property of such materials is their ability to be polarised to have two apparent electrical poles - that's why they are called "**dielectrics**".
## Polarisation
Indeed, for a non-conductive material, the internal arrangement of the material is constrained such that no native constituent is free to move about the lattice. They can, however, move ever so slightly away from their original location, still tightly bound to one another. This is what happens to the material when placed in an electric field. 

The field drags the positive charges in one direction, and negative charges in the other, separating them, creating many microscopic dipoles throughout the material. Alternatively, the field orients existing dipoles to align in the same diretion after internal drag.

## Polarisation Field
Notice that the internal bound charges will still cancel to neutral, but there is now a thin layer of naked surface charge distribution on either side of the material. There is now a **total dipole moment** for the cuboid material:
$$\sigma A\vec d$$
where $\sigma$ is the surface charge density, $A$ is the cross sectional area of the material, and $d$ is the length of the material. The formula above is a simple application of the dipole moment formula. 

Since this total dipole moment must be the sum of all the microscopic dipole moments, we can assume that the total dipole moment is distributed locally throughout the material. Let us define the **polarisation field** which is equivalent to the **dipole moment density field**:
$$\vec P=\frac{\sigma A\vec d}{V}=\vec\sigma$$
where $\vec\sigma:=\sigma\hat d$ and $V$ is the volume of the material. 

We see that, the **magnitude of the polarisation field** is equivalent to the **surface charge density** emerging on the two ends of a polarised material. 
## The Effect of Polarisation on the Electric Field internal to the Dielectric
The Electric field inside the material is altered by polarisation. Each microscopic dipole creates its own electric field, pointing against the external electric field. This means that within the material, the actual electric field is smaller.
