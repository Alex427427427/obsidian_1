A hollow conductor. Almost all this document's conclusions come from the article [[6 Conduction, Conductance and Resistance, Energy Dissipation]]. 

1. An ideal conductor shields all interior from electric fields and exists as an equipotential. A hollow cavity inside will not experience any electric field. 
2. They have no effect on steady or low frequency magnetic fields, because magnetic field lines can permeate it. 
3. High frequency electromagnetic fields are shielded via the skin effect, because the maxwell's equations yield exponential decaying amplitude solutions in ideal conductors. [[Skin Effect]]
4. Faraday cages can actually have holes and still be effective at shielding electromagnetic waves. This is dependent on the wavelength of the waves, since the effect at play is diffraction; the smaller the hole, the greater the diffraction and the more of the field that passes through is directed transversely at one another, cancelling out. Larger holes that result in less diffraction allow more of the field to propagate longitudinally. 
5. While external fields are blocked, fields generated internally can in fact always escape. Changing fields will have to additionally overcome the skin effect. 
6. Sometimes, unintentional faraday cages from metallic building frames and elevators mean that phone signals cannot penetrate through.
