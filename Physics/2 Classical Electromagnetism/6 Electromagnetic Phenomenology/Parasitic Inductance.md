Inductance is a phenomenon that exists with all conductive material surrounded by insulating media. The dimensional dependence of inductance is:
$$L=\frac{N^2\mu A}{l}$$
But it has a different form for unwound conductors. 

Usually this effect is negligible, and the prominent inductance in a circuit exists at special locations encapsulated by the human intended inductors. 

However, at high enough permeability of the surrounding material, a conductor not intended to harbor inductance can have enough inductance to produce noticeable effects on the rest of the circuit. Physically this corresponds to all the magnetic flux circulating the conductor as a result of the current in the conductor, storing its inertia. 

The effect can be better understood in the frequency domain, where we study the effect of the inductance on voltage and current signals. Impedance is the phasor variable that shows this via the phasor ohm's law. The impedance as a result of inductance is proportional to frequency of the signal. At high enough frequencies, everything is an inductor.
