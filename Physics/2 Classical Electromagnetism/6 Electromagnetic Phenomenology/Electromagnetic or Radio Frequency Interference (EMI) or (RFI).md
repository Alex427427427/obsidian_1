## Through Electromagnetic Induction
All changing currents have a changing magnetic field in the space enveloping it. This space, if uninterrupted, extends indefinitely. Of course, it reaches into other parts of the circuit too. A changing magnetic field produces electric field circulation. Conductors immersed in that will conduct extra current. The physics of electromagnetism is linear, so we can simply understand the extra current as added directly onto the existing current. 

This is essentially parasitic cross inductance. [[Parasitic Inductance]]
## Through Conduction
Electric fields, when impinging on conductors, cause current flow. Any extra-circuital electric field cause additional conduction. 
## Via EM Waves
The above two effects can be caused by different parts of the circuit on one another. But in fact, these effects can come from afar. EM waves ([[Electromagnetic Waves]]) decay at a rate of $1/r$ thus their effects can persist almost indefinitely. 
## Consequences
Any large loop formed by a circuit will pick up noise from environmental changing magnetic fields. 

Any long isolated conductor will pick up noise from environmental electric fields. 

For the above reasons, circuit area is always minimised. And whenever conductors need to be long, they must form pairs - such that the net effect of the electric field on the circuit is greatly cancelled. To make this cancellation total, wind the cable pairs in a helical pattern.
