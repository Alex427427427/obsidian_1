The result of [[Dielectric (Insulator) Breakdown]].

Two objects with different levels of charge (hence electric potential), will eventually have electric fields that are strong enough to ionize (strip electrons from bound to free) whatever medium separates them. This region of ionisation extends outward, its reach depending on the strength of the electric field. As soon as the regions of ionisation touch, there is a path of current conduction, and current conducts. Usually grows fractally. If the conduction causes enough heat, it could glow as black body radiation. This usually happens very quickly until all the charge is evenly spread between the bodies again. 

While the discharge is happening, most of the electric field is redirected to focus around the discharge current paths; ionisation of the untouched air is gone. 

[[Arc]] and [[Lightning]] are special cases of this.
