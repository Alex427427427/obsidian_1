Usually insulators are polarised when an electric field permeates it. But when the electric field is strong enough i.e. there is a large enough potential difference, the material will be ionised and once the ionization regions expand enough to connect to form a continuous path, they will violently conduct electricity. This conduction has no easily predicted paths, and usually spreads out fractally. This is dielectric breakdown. 

It is a critical failure mode of PCBs. It is also what happens to the air at lightning.
