___
Lightning is a vast current. A special case of [[Electrostatic Discharge]], composed of an [[Arc]] and caused by [[Dielectric (Insulator) Breakdown]], where it is the air that get's ionized. 
## Process
Strikingly, the exact process is not fully understood and still being studied, but scientists agree on some basic elements. 
##### Location
1. Between 2 regions in the same cloud
2. Between 2 clouds
3. Between the clouds and the ground
##### The Lightning Itself
First, the lightning itself:
1. Vast volumes of charge must have been displaced between two regions of the atmosphere, or the atmosphere and ground. 
2. Eventually the strong electric field strips surrounding regions of electrons and ionizes them. 
3. Once the two regions' expanding volumes of ionization touch, current can flow, and it does
Considering it take about 3.3 megavolts to create an arc with a distance of 1 meter, we can imagine how powerful a lightning is. 
##### Residual Effects
1. Light - black body radiation from the immense heat that comes from the electrical conduction through air. 
2. Sound - the initial release of vast volumes of current results in a high pressure wave that propagates through air. 
##### Cause of the Charge Displacement
Though the full details are not entirely understood, charge displacement mostly occurs in updrafts, which themselves are caused by temperature difference. The rising air contains ice crystals (looking somewhat like snowflakes), while the descending air contains soft hail crystals. When these particles collide, the ice crystals become positively charged while the hail crystals become negatively charged. This is the triboelectric effect, where charge likes to transfer between materials upon friction. [[Triboelectric Effect]]
## Lightning Rods
Lightning rods make sure to be the first point of contact for the radially expanding ionisation region, such that any current from the lightning discharge will follow that path, and go straight into ground. In the generalisation that lightning sources will be at least above the height of the rod, the protective zone around a lightning rod is a cone with spherical profile.
