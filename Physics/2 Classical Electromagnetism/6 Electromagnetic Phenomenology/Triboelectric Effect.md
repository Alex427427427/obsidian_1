A curious phenomenon occurs when 2 objects are made to contact, with a certain minimal amount of energy in the process, typically provided with rubbing. Charge becomes displaced, always in the same direction, regardless of how charged up they are. 

The answer is the valence electron's affinity towards each object's nuclei. A well known chemical effect ultimately explained by atomic physics, the full details are not ironed out. When the atoms of both object come in contact and collide, the valence electron of one goes to the other that has more affinity for electrons. The electron, by transfering to the other atom, is able to lose energy doing so. The reverse process is very difficult, not even the now extra proton in the other atom can attract the electron back. This effect is local, thus doesn't really care about the overall charge of the objects. Rather, the extra free charges migrate further inward to accommodate the newly introduced electrons. Over time, a large potential difference can build up between the two objects. Once the electrons have been displaced, since the two objects are separated usually by air, charge cannot return to their home and remain displaced. 

The oppositely charged objects will now be attracted to each other.
