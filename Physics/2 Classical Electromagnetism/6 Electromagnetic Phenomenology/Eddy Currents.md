Changing magnetic field through a conductor has an associated electric field vorticity. 
$$\frac{\partial \vec B}{\partial t}=-\nabla\times\vec E$$
This means a conductor with a changing magnetic field permeating it will result in current loops through the material. This is the eddy current. Of force, this effect is determined by permeability ([[8 Permeability and Magnetic Susceptibility]]). 

Eddy currents can be used for heating, because the generated current will dissipate energy according to the ohm's law
$$\vec J=\sigma\vec E$$
Additionally, it can be used to explain the skin effect in high frequency circuits. ([[Skin Effect]])
