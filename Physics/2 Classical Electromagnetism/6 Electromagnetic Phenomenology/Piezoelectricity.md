___
Polarisation occurs when electric field is applied across a polarisable material. If the material is a rigid crystal in an ionic lattice, then polarisation can only occur via deformation of the inter-particle links along appropriate axes. Conversely, if the inter-particle links are compressed or stretched, a net charge displacement must be observed at the two ends of the material. Thus: 
1. Voltage applied across a piezoelectric material will stretch and compress it along appropriate axes. The sign controls whether it's compression or stretching. 
2. Compression and stretching of a piezoelectric material will produce a voltage across it. 
3. An oscillating voltage will result in vibration of the material. 
4. Vibration of the material is an oscillating voltage source.
