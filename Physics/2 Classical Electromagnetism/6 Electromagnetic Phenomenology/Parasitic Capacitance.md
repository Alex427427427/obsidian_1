Capacitance is a phenomenon that exists between all conductive surfaces separated by insulating media, no matter how far away. The dimensional dependence of capacitance is:
$$C=\frac{\epsilon A}{d}$$
Usually this effect is negligible, and the prominent capacitance in a circuit exists at special locations encapsulated by the human intended capacitors. 

However, at close enough separation, two conducting surfaces not intended to have capacitance between them can have a large enough capacitance to produce noticeable effects on the rest of the circuit. Physically, this corresponds to electric fields formed between conductor pairs that store potential energy that can be readily released; from the outside it looks like charge is displaced from one conductor to another. Two conductors that have this effect are said to be **capacitively coupled**, or **electrostatically coupled**. 

The effect can be better understood in the frequency domain, where we study the effect of the capacitance on voltage and current signals. Impedance is the phasor variable that shows this via the phasor ohm's law. The higher the frequency, the lower the impedance of capacitive components. Thus at high frequencies it's as if current can flow between conductors that should be separated.
