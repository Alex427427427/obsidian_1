An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is a sharp pulse of the electromagnetic field. The sharpness means that it contains a wide range of frequency components, decipherable via Fourier Transform. They can disrupt circuits. 

The source of an EMP can be any sudden electromagnetic phenomena. 
1. Lightning or any powerful electrostatic discharge
2. The ionising radiation wavefront of a nuclear explosion 
3. The sharp edged voltage signals of digital components in a circuit
