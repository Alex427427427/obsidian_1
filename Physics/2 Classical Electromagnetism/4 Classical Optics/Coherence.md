## Temporal Coherence
When a wave has a short bandwidth of temporal frequencies passing through a fixed location. So long as the source is temporally coherent, the emitted waves will always be temporally coherent.

Pictured above is when a plane wave has varying frequencies over time, and a time scale over which the wave's frequency is near constant - the coherence time; we can associate a coherence length with that time. This coherence length is a property pointing in the longitudinal direction of wave propagation. 
## Spatial Coherence
When a wave looks like a plane wave in some area over space, the wave is said to be coherent over that space.

Pictured above is a generic wave generated by a randomly distributed set of synchronised sources. So the wave is guaranteed to be temporally coherent. However, it is spatially incoherent. Only at small areas that intercept this wave, is the wave nearly a plane wave. This is the coherence area. The coherence area is a property in the transverse direction to wave propagation. 
## Interference
The interference phenomenon is pronounced when waves are spatially coherent. 
## Decoherence
When waves become spatially decoherent, interference effects disappear.
