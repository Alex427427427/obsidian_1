## Temporal Coherence
When a wave has a short bandwidth of temporal frequencies passing through a fixed location. So long as the source is temporally coherent, the emitted waves will always be temporally coherent. 
## Spatial Coherence
When a wave looks like a plane wave in some area over space, the wave is said to be coherent over that space. 
## Interference
The interference phenomenon is pronounced when waves are spatially coherent. 
## Decoherence
When waves become decoherent, interference effects disappear.
