## The Profile
The desired transverse profile of many lasers. 
Transverse profile:

Longitudinal profile:

We see that the only spreading of the profile occurs as a linear projection. This approaches the theoretical ideal of beam confinement. 
## Motivation
From Fourier optics we know that the far field radiation pattern from any aperture is the fourier transform of that aperture. From fourier analysis we know that the gaussian is a special distribution that is invariant under the fourier transform. 

Thus a gaussian aperture - producing a gaussian profile - will remain gaussian regardless of how far it travels. 

Lenses that perform the Fourier Transform to refocus the beam, will preserve the gaussian profile.
