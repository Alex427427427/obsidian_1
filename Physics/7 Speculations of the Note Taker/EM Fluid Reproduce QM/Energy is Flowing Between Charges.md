Electric field lines could be the flow lines of some incompressible fluid like substance. Is there really something flowing out and into charges at the speed of light?

[[18 Maxwell Potential Equations in The Lorentz Gauge]] suggests that it's the **potentials** being broadcasted. Energy is the fluid flowing out. Where's the source? **Do all positive charges and negative charges connect via some tube**? **Consider black and white holes**. Could relate to entanglement and non-local properties of wavefunction collapse. 

The energy density must follow some non intuitive properties that turn out to be equivalent to quantum wavefunctions, such as **linear superposition related interference**. Coincidence? 

If modelled as such, the repulsion and attraction are negative and positive pressure. **Field lines exert pressure because energy is actually flowing, and they replicate QED's virtual photon exchanges with the boomerang and baseball analogies**. **Try modelling photons as dirac deltas of the outflowing energy density**? This would reveal a more explicit quantisation. But we may not even need it because the fluid explains photoelectric effect. [[Photon, Energy transfer via electric field]] 

If photons are the quantisation of the energy fluid that is the electromagnetic field, then there would only be a scaling law if the thing receiving the photons have size. **Electrons must have size.** 

In this theory charges do literally throw photons at one another along the paths of the EM fields. **What is bending the path of photons**? Could this have a macroscopic residual effect that is gravity?
