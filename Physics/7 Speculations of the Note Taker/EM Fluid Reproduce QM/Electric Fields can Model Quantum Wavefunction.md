The electric field can undergo linear interference. The square magnitude is proportional to local energy density, hence mass distribution. The quantum wavefunction, similarly can interfere and the square magnitude is the probability density of finding a particle there. If we take this interpretation seriously, can we recover most of the quantum wavefunction behaviour? 

Well, if we say that the particle's mass is distributed over space, we must explain how its entire mass is found at one location upon measurement. This is the same problem as the measurement problem. How does the sudden contraction work? 

Another point. If there exists a potential that the electric field is the gradient of, does there also exist a potential which the quantum wavefunction (if expressed as a real vector embedded in space), is a gradient of? Is there a divergence of the wavefunction? Is there a curl? What could they be interpreted as? So many questions. 

The myriad vibrations of the EM field could explain virtual particles

Could a 3D vector field reproduce all QM phenomena, compared to the 2D complex field? Can the 3D version produce spin while the 2D one can't? Maybe Dirac already did similar things to provide 4 DOF as a quaternion, or paired complex numbers. 

The 3 DOF electric field is enough to model polarisation of EM waves, which is equivalent to quantum spin. 

Problem: The quantum wavefunction is nonlocal in space despite being local in configuration space. The electric field is local in both.
