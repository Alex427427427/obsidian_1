Consider the sequence of approximations done in describing Fraunhofer diffraction. 

Every step we move further away, we introduce an approximation that eliminates high order effects. 

The lower the order, the further the effect reaches. 

Perhaps gravity is that low order effect of some higher order theory - EM? QCD?
