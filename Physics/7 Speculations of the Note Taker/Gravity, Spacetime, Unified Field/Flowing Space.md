All special and general relativistic phenomena can be understood as topological solitons traveling through flowing space, and that space is the ether over which electromagnetic radiation propagates. 

Exercise: Prove that flowing space reproduces general relativity. 
Requires: diff geo, GR knowledge. 
### Problems
So the ether flows into massed objects, which themselves are solitons on this ether. Where does the ether go?
