There are so many tantalising clues that point to electrons and positrons being photons made to spin in place somehow. It's just out of reach. It's so frustrating! 

1. Spinor algebra follows polarisation state algebra
2. Electrons and Positrons come out of phase conservation of the wave function. In QED, they are particles whose abstract phase evolves forward and backward in time. 
3. Photons can have phase evolve forward and backward in time. 
4. When an electron and positron meet, they become 2 photons. 
5. A photon can join and disappear into an electron as a stationary spherical harmonic. An electron is a captured photon. 
6. Electron has the same unit action as a photon. 
7. [[Vortices attract and repel according to spin]]
