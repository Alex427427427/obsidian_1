Photon is distributed as it propagates. Self interference occurs over vast distances.

Photon must be non local because it performs a unit action and is fully absorbed at the sight of interaction instantaneously. 

How do we reconcile this with gravity? 

How can distributed entities instantaneously contract at the sight of interaction? 

Bohmian mechanics postulates that all particles are connected nonlocally with the wavefunction. It is nonlocal in actual space but is it local in hamiltonian phase space?
