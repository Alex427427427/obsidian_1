### Flowing space
Try to prove that space flowing inward to mass over time reproduces the spacetime curvature in GR. This is just a reframing. 

Requirements: Diff geo, GR, fluid dynamics (for the proving), and check that this has been done or refuted. 
### Topological Solitons Reproducing Spin Statistics
See if topological solitons of certain topology can reproduce spin-1/2 exchange statistics. 

Requirements: Topology, Group theory, Condensed matter physics, check that this has been done or refuted. 
### Topological Solitons in a Spherical Potential
See if topological states can be trapped in spherical potential and form similar wave function states like the spherical harmonics in eigenstates of hydrogen atom.

Requirements: Topology, group theory, condensed matter physics, check that this has been done or refuted. 
### Topological Solitons as Travelling Wave States
See if topological states can propagate like a plane wave and result in interference patterns behind a double slit. 
### Gravitational Analogs in Condensed Matter Physics
Whether similar effects to pulling material inward can happen around topological defects in condensed matter. 
### Topological Defects in Fluids
See if topological defects like vortices in fluids can reproduce the time dilation and length contraction found in topological solitons through condensed matter.
