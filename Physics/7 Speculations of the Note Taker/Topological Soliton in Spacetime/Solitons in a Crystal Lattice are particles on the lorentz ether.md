"Special Relativity hidden in a series of coupled mechanical pendula" by "Physics - problems and solutions" channel, by Lukas Rafaj, a PhD in theoretical physics in Czechia as of 2024. 

Not only do bound states scatter and annihilate one another (releasing phonons), they also contract in length through the medium and experience time dilation. The slanted-ness of their plane of simultaneity results in the perceived reciprocation of time dilation and length contraction in the ether frame. 

Could Knots or Twists in the Lattice Lead to Metric Changes, Describing Gravity?
A soliton is tethered to the surroundings. This could reproduce the spin 1/2 phenomena. 

How do solitons explain the measurement problem tho?
