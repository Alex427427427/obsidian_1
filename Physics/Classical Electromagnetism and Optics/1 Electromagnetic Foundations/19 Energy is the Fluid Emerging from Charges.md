We are finally ready to understand just what exactly is outflowing from charges and currents. The inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations in potential form, in the Lorentz gauge that conserves total energy, are: 
**charge source law**:
$$\boxed{\left(\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}-\nabla^2\right)\phi=\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}}$$
**current source law:**
$$\boxed{\left(\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}-\nabla^2\right)\vec A=\mu_0\vec J}$$
In free space, the potentials satisfy the wave equation. This means that they readily flow in a conserved manner. They flow out from the charge and current sources at the speed of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0\epsilon_0}}=c$. 

This also matches the relationship between the electric field intensity and the electric field line density. If the field lines describe the flow of potential, then of course the density of the lines over space - 1st order derivative - is the field. 

The Lorentz gauge also makes this idea clear. 
$$\boxed{\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot\vec A=0}$$
We see that the scalar potential is a stationary energy density (per unit charge) with a suggestive scaling, whereas the vector potentials is simply the flow of the energy density (per unit charge). While the charge is stationary, energy is held in the field around it. As a charge flows, the magnetic potential  shows that the energy in the enveloping electric field is migrating in the same direction as the charge's motion.
