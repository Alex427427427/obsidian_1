___
A cycle through the Pressure - Volume space involving the [[Ideal Gas Law]]. 
- Some gas is brought in contact with the inner walls of the refrigerator, receiving heat. 
- That gas is sent to a location where it is rapidly compressed, raising its temperature and pressure due to the ideal gas law, making the same amount of heat more concentrated and at higher temperature than the surrounding. 
- The compressed gas is cooled to the surrounding temperature.
- The gas is sent to a location where it rapidly expands and cools as a result of the ideal gas law. 
- This colder-than-air gas is then brought in contact with the inner walls of the refrigerator again, beginning the cycle anew.
In summary, compress, naturally cool, expand, send to where cooling is desired, repeat.
