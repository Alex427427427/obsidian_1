A generalisation of coordinate transformations $Q_i(q)$; a transformation of phase space. 

The new coordinates and momenta $Q$ and $P$ can be functions of both coordinate and momenta. i.e. we can mix coordinate and momenta. $Q_i(q, p)$.

These transformations ought also satisfy the property that the equations of motion in the new coordinates are of Hamiltonian form. i.e. there exists some function $K$ of the new coordinates $Q$, $P$ such that:
$$\dot Q_i=\frac{\partial K}{\partial P_i}$$
$$\dot P_i=-\frac{\partial K}{\partial Q_i}$$
The function $K$ will play the role as the new hamiltonian in the new coordinate set. 

Consider Hamilton's principle (least action but with H subbed in), before and after the canonical transform, with gauge freedom of a total time derivative added, the integrands equate. That function whose time derivative we added, can be a funciton of all old and new coords. Splitting it into 4 classes; F(q, Q), F(p, Q), F(p, Q), F(p, P). And subbing back in. Collect like terms. Coefficients equal 0. You can extract the canonical transformations and the new hamiltonian. 

**The flow vector field of the Hamiltonian is itself a canonical transformation**.
