For the first time, motion of massed objects were understood in quantifiable properties. The motion of planets and stars, of every daily object, of liquids and gases, are described by these classical laws of physics. Objects change their motion due to forces. Objects deliver and receive momentum and energy. All objects universally gravitate towards one another. For a time, this was all that was needed to understand the world. Though the sources of these forces, momenta, and energy, and the exact local mechanisms of their transfer were still not understood, their abstracted treatment and their *effects* on motion was understood enough. Their true nature will be unlocked in electromagnetism, but that is a story for another time. 

This is the birth place of modern science.
