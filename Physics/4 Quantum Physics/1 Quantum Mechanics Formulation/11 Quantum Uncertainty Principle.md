## Facts
1. The position space and spatial frequency spaces are direct Fourier conjugate spaces
2. Direct Fourier conjugate spaces have a normalisation factor $2\pi$.
3. Fourier uncertainty principle shows that the product of conjugate space distribution uncertainties is equal to the reciprocal of the normalisation factor. 
4. The power distribution will cause a dilation by a factor of $\sqrt 2$ in the gaussian distribution of each space. Thus the power distributions additionally divide the uncertainty product by 2. 
## The Quantum Uncertainty Principle
Considering the position and spatial frequency Fourier transform, we know that 
$$\Delta x_{wavefunction}\Delta\frac{1}{\lambda}_{wavefunction}=\frac{1}{2\pi}$$
Converting to wave number $k=2\pi/\lambda$ gives: 
$$\Delta x_{wavefunction}\Delta k_{wavefunction}=1$$
Converting to momentum $p=\hbar k$ gives: 
$$\Delta x_{wavefunction}\Delta p_{wavefunction}=\hbar$$
Converting to the distribution involves squaring, which translates to dilation of the gaussian distributions by a factor of $\sqrt 2$ horizontally. Thus:
$$\boxed{\Delta x\Delta p=\frac{\hbar}{2}}$$
Note that this is the fundamental uncertainty limit, and it is usually quoted to take into account of additional uncertainty of the measurement process. Thus it is an inequality:
$$\boxed{\Delta x\Delta p\leq\frac{\hbar}{2}}$$
## Conjugate Variables
All conjugate variables follow that uncertainty principle.
