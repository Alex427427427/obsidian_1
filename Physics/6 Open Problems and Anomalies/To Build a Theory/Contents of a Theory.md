*(The Statistical Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics L. E. BALLENTINE Department of Physics, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C., Canada)*
## Essence
An physical theory can be divided to:
1. A mathematical formalism that contains a set of primitive concepts, relations between these concepts (either postulated or given by rules of deduction), and a dynamical law. 
2. Correspondence rules which relate the theoretical concepts to the world of experience. 

This division is not total, for one must have a formalism in order to make correspondence rules, and unless one has some faint idea of what the correspondence looks like, they cannot develop the formalism. 
## Completeness
(*Einstein* - Can Quantum Mechanical Descriptions of Reality be Considered Complete?)
1. A necessary condition for a complete theory is that “every element of physical reality must have a counterpart in the physical theory.” 
2. A sufficient condition for identifying an element of reality is, “If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with probability equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity.”
Their argument then proceeds by showing, through consideration of a thought experiment, that two noncommuting observables should, under suitable conditions, both be considered elements of reality. Since no state vector can provide the value of both of these observables, they conclude that the quantum state vector cannot completely describe an individual system, but only an ensemble of similarily prepared systems.
