## Themes 
[[Information]] and [[Humanity's Triumph]]. See those documents. 
## Big Idea
Crazy conspiracy theories sweep over a continent and a government task force (within which is the protagonist) is deployed to dispell them. A hidden true conspiracy from within the government is revealed, and the protagonists urgently try to stop it. Central mysteries along the way hold the answers to how it can be stopped. By the end, a full dialogue (in whatever form) between the two sides of the information debate outlined in [[Information]] should have played out, preferably near the climax.
