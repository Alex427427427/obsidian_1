## Themes 
[[Information]] and [[Humanity's Triumph]]. See those documents. 
## Big Idea
Crazy conspiracy theories sweep over a continent and a government task force (within which is the protagonist) is deployed to dispell them. A hidden true conspiracy from within the government is revealed, and the protagonists urgently try to stop it. Central mysteries along the way hold the answers to how it can be stopped. By the end, a full dialogue (in whatever form) between the two sides of the information debate outlined in [[Information]] should have played out, preferably near the climax. 

Additionally, I want the major mystery thread to be about Marco's cryptic messages, Dark Matter, and the fact that alien civilisations exist in abundance in the dark sectors of the universe. A fact that Lucas realises near the end to save the day. 
##### Alien Thread
The alien thread has a few unresolved ideas. 
1. How does Marco come to realise there are aliens? In my set up, they are the apparent dark matter that we cannot see. But how does Marco realise they are aliens? 
2. Why must Marco keep this a secret? 
3. The communication must be instant for Lucas to contact the aliens at the end and have it have any effect on the story. How would the communication work?
