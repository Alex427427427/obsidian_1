## Important to Keep in Mind
The hook of the story - the promise set by the premise to the reader - you must deliver them. 
**Illuminati; conspiracy theorists; aliens.**
## Act 1
##### Begin with Microcosm of the Story, Set Expectations, Introduce Cast
*{Show the reader "this is a story about conspiracies".}*

##### Inciting Incident
*{A slip up in the Conspiracy's otherwise perfect plan.}*

##### The First threshold
*{Seeker pulls on the first thread that reveals how deep and big the Conspiracy is, and alludes to what it is all about.}*

## Act 2
##### Main Investigation Stage
*{Seeker gains information, encounters resistance from the Conspiracy.}*

##### Turning Point 
*{The plot has a major twist. Everything that came before has been recast into a new light. Big things are coming after. Appropriate time to execute the end of a social conflict plot within the seeker group.}*

##### Despair Stage
*{The Conspiracy makes an active move against the seeker, and utterly crush them. Their companions die. The mole reveals themselves.}*

The secret police capture Lucas and Susan at the edge of the Eurasian continent, and bring them into the Eurasian Nucleus for interrogation of treason. Patricia tries to bring both Susan and Lucas away, but Alma intercepts and takes Lucas. Alma speaks to Lucas about his journey, while Patricia brings Susan to her home. Alma tells Lucas that mistakes can be forgiven, and tells him of her own investigations - that whatever he has been involved with, is not the real Enlightenment Society - the real one went defunct decades ago. In a twist, Patricia revels it was her that notified the secret police, and that she was the leader of a conspiracy all along, separate from the government; **Patricia kills Susan** for fear that she knows how to stop the conspiracy, having lived together with Marco. 

Lucas realises things aren't as they seem exactly, but can't trust Alma fully. While Alma asks him for everything he knows, he faces the agonising choice of siding with Patricia or Alma. He decides to protect Patricia. He made the wrong choice. He tells Alma he wants to go see Susan, and visit Patricia; Alma lets him. 

When Lucas later goes to Patricia, he finds Patricia having just played the song to Susan. When Lucas kneels beside Susan, he notices how her black dress glistens in the light. Patricia explains her world view and plan to Lucas, how **seeing all the information that suggests humanity's one way ticket to extinction has turned her hopeless, and the only hope is a peaceful transcendence of humanity into the frequency domain**, drawing an analogy to euthanising the dying, and she plans to do it by **playing the song to everyone through the continental speaker network that Lucas and Marco had been helping to build.** She asks him to join her. He doesn't answer, so she places him on house arrest at an unknown apartment, sends a resignation letter to the DAP, erasing his existence. She says she likes him as a talent and would hope he turns around to the plan one day. Lucas is allowed to bury Susan at a location of his choice, accompanied by guards. 
## Act 3
##### Recovery and Revelation
*{Seeker has the final, most important piece of enlightenment. Knows how to defeat the Conspiracy. Seeker sets it in motion.}*

Patricia places a catatonic Lucas in an apartment in a new city, with guards watching him. Through the news, Lucas knows that the continental speaker network is due to complete construction in a week. The guards comment how the workers at the construction sites are all part of the conspiracy. The DAP catches on that Lucas' resignation is suspicious, and declares it an anomaly for everyone to investigate. They visit the regional governments and pinpoint Lucas to one particular city. Eventually they locate Lucas in his building. 

Lucas spends all his days watching tv during the day, and gazing out the window at night. One night, he sees a star blink. This reminds him of the first case he solved - the mystery of the blinking star. He looks down, sees people phasing in and out of the city lights, and has an epiphany. He remembers seeing Susan's dress, and her wallet containing Marco's final poem for her. He remembers telling a conspiracy theorist they have no idea what they are talking about. He remembers Susan, mostly importantly telling him "you just need to talk". Looking at the blinking star, he realises he had the final piece of the puzzle all along; he now understands - just as Marco had - a secret that embraced all modern history. 

Lucas requests to bring his collection of movies so he can watch them; the guards do so. Among them is the recorded tv segment of Lucas presenting the discovery of Satellite 6. the guards think he has gone crazy, indulging in himself, watching it over and over. Two days before the completion of the continental speaker network, a friend from the DAP has finally found Lucas, and can communicate with him through a precision sonar device from afar; Lucas communicates back via random body gestures dictated by the friend. Lucas tells the friend to try to stop the construction and to manufacture ear shields at the Factory Array. The friend does so. Shortly after, the Factory Array sends drones to outside Lucas' window, but gets shot down by the guards before it can initiate communication. 

Patricia catches the friend, brings them to Lucas, and kills the friend in front of him. Lucas sees on tv how the DAP gets arrested for trying to sabotage the continental speaker array. She explains how there is nothing he can do, and he should give up just as she has - then there will be no pain. 
##### Final Battle
*{The final showdown where the seeker defeats the Conspiracy. The biggest twists of the story executed here.}*

The day arrives, the speaker construction is complete; Patricia commands the conspiracy to play the song. All of humanity falls asleep; their consciousness transferred to the frequency domain. 

In the frequency domain, a few major things happen:
1. Humans greet those original people at the world war period. 
2. Susan meets Marco. 
3. Patricia imagines herself being welcomed to a reunion. Lucas' primary school class, all grown up. It turns out **Patricia was Miss Liam all along**. 

Lucas meets Patricia in the frequency domain. He points out how Patricia's goals were never for the totality of mankind, but herself - she wanted to reunite with the students, most of whom she was unable to save. Patricia protected Lucas throughout the story, because he was one of them. 

Outside, Alma and some DAP agents are still standing - they deliberately injured their ears to make themselves deaf. They realise that the Factory Array is the only entity that will still be awake other than themselves, so they go to it. 

Lucas reveals why Patricia killed Marco - because he was the only one that truly had something that could stop her conspiracy. He explains that the "ghosts between the city lights" Marco spoke of are actually **alien civilisations hiding in between the stars**, that show up as dark matter. He deduces that the boltzmann noise on the original spacetime channel were actually the communications between these aliens. And that the doomsday song's true origin was the alien civilisations. It was the **first half of a promise** that humanity was unable to fulfill. **The Factory Array has been searching, for the coordinates of Satellite 6**, so it can establish communication with the aliens and declare that humanity was now a peaceful species. An inverse song would then be sent back, reversing the effects of the original doomsday song. Back when the Factory Array sent drones to Lucas, the only important part was that it could see Lucas' tv screen, where he played the segment during which he deduced that the blinking star was Satellite 6. The Factory Array, upon receiving it, internally thanked Lucas - that thanks to him, everything has fallen into place. 

Patricia's plans will be destroyed, and she falls to her knees. She begs Lucas to come sit beside her, on her death bed. 

DAP plays the song at various nodes of the speaker network. The world begins to wake up. 

Susan is glad to be with Marco, but he tells her she must go and live a good life with Lucas - Susan's form is phasing away from the frequency domain, presumably back to the world. Susan is confused because her body would have decayed long ago. Marco tells her that someone must had preserved it. We see that Lucas had put her body in the abandoned cryogenic vaults. 
##### New World
*{The new state of the world after the events of the story.}*
People are waking up in their homes. The streets are filled with car crashes but otherwise empty. Lucas goes to the abandoned cryogenic vault to find Susan. They walk together into the city lights.
