# Part 1
Emergency tapes. Factory Array. Man wearing glasses and a trench coat stands in a room, kneeling beside a corpse. 

**Lucas**: No abnormalities. No wounds or signs of struggle. Only the hum of machinery. 

Lucas notices how peaceful Marco looks. 

**Lucas**: "You look so calm and peaceful. How unlike you."

He also notes how the door to his office was locked when Marco was discovered. 

**Lucas**: You always said the world was full of mysteries. Now look at you. You've become one. 

**Lucas**: Why do you think we stopped talking? 

Lucas walks around the room, noticing the pristine conditions of Marco's office. There are no gas leaks. (Question for GPT: how was Lucas able to deduce no gas leaks?)

**Lucas**: I'm sorry. I don't have a clue what happened to you. 

**Lucas**: Is this really going to be how it ends?

**Lucas**: Enlighten me, Marco. Just one more time. 

Marco only lays on the floor, eyes closed, still smiling, as if in a happy dream. 

Suddenly, Lucas notices the puzzle box that Marco and Lucas solved during uni. He takes it. 

Lucas walks out, and notices some men in black standing in the distance, looking at him. 

At home, Lucas opens the puzzle box. There is a note inside. It has a symbol of the all-seeing eye. It reads: 

There are ghosts beneath the city lights. Lovers. Ocean. Susan. To stop the disaster, I have hidden a great treasure where all paths converge. There are no aliens in Eurasia.
