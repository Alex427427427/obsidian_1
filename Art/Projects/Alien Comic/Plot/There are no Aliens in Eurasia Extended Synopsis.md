## Important to Keep in Mind
The hook of the story - the promise set by the premise to the reader - you must deliver them. Frequently remind with the phrase "there are no aliens in Eurasia."
**Illuminati; conspiracy theorists; aliens.**
## Part 1 - The Department of Abnormal Phenomena
##### Begin with Microcosm of the Story, Set Expectations, Introduce Cast
*{Show the reader "this is a story about conspiracies, illuminati, aliens".}*

The Illuminati members observe Lucas throughout these episodes until they decide to recruit him at the end. 

Episodic stories: 
- Alien abduction in District 14 as cover up for murder - microcosm, introduce DAP, strange neighbour, command economy
- Star Blinking - introduce Satellite 6, astrophysics, Tom, set up Eurasian Academy of Science, Director Patricia Williams of the Department of Information and Statistics, space being fake conspiracy
- UFO sighting via telescope - introduce Oceania, war, Factory Array, hint at why Lucas investigates aliens (Marco)
- Alien Sighting, Strange Disease at The Eurasian Academy of Sciences - introduce Susan, emotion disease via tv, Lambda, secret police, see alien
- Missing teacher for Class of 72 - introduce Miss Liam plot line
- Power Outages at Lumina Junction - discover hideout of Illuminati near the Subterra Station, including abandoned cryogenic vaults 
##### Inciting Incident
*{A slip up in the Conspiracy's otherwise perfect plan (Marco death).}*

Flash back, Lucas finds Marco dead at the Factory Array. Marco left behind a message for Lucas, telling him to look after Susan and that there are ghosts in between the city lights. Marco expresses loneliness for he has no one to trust. There were also cryptic paintings:
- A white ocean under a starry sky - the frequency domain
- A Subterra Station - location unknown
- Two people holding hands in front of a bustling city
The reason Marco is only giving hints throughout the story instead of outright telling Lucas, is to compartmentalise the truth, and to help Lucas act at the right moment. 

Susan was interrogated, and Lucas moved near Susan to monitor Susan under the guise of welfare monitoring. The two share a quiet year together. At the end, Susan moves away to the Eurasian Academy of Sciences, after making Lucas promise not to look into Marco's death. Susan is upset at Lucas because he isn't able to give any answers. Lucas sees one alien looking organism in the shadows of the city. 
##### The First threshold
*{Seeker pulls on the first thread that reveals how deep and big the Conspiracy is, and alludes to what it is all about (Marco's clue "Look for the ghosts between the city lights").}*

Turns out the Subterra Station is under the Lumina Junction District. In the present, Lucas finds the Illuminati at the Subterra Station, with Director Patricia Williams of the Department of Information and Statistics. She introduces Lucas to the Illuminati - now called the Enlightenment Society. They introduce their plot - to establish the Earth Federation again. And they have (or are looking for?) the Earth Federation Constitution. They need Lucas' help; Lucas joins them only to investigate what Marco died for, and give Susan an answer. 
## Part 2 - The Enlightenment Society
##### Main Investigation Stage
*{Seeker gains information (look for aliens, finds Illuminati), encounters resistance from the Conspiracy (avoidance -> distraction -> intimidation).}*

Lucas is assigned to conceal abnormal phenomena related to the Enlightenment Society's reconstruction of the continental speaker network. Lucas runs into the secret police a few times, having to use his wits to deal with them. The main plan of the Enlightenment Society is spreading information - of what the Eurasian government killed Marco for, which still awaits answers. They are all searching - for the ghosts in between the city lights, which they have seen a few times. 

Meanwhile, Susan requires assistance for the disease she is researching. With Lucas' privileges, Susan and Lucas are able to follow her patients across Eurasia, in order to isolate the disease transmission vector. At a tango event, Susan invites Lucas to a dance. They remember their university days. 

Susan asks for Lucas for the genetic records of the population. Upon receiving it, she sees a drastic increase of deafness after the war. She deduces the method of transmission, or the source of the disease. Finally, a taste of victory for Susan. All she has to do is to confirm it with experiment, and present her findings to the World Science Foundation. She shares these findings with Lucas first, walking at night. She notices the air smells like winter. Lucas explains that the winter smell is people burning wood at fireplaces. They realise there is a fire - and it is coming from the University. Her chances of further studying the disease are destroyed. 
##### Turning Point 
*{The plot has a major twist (Aliens are the disease). Everything that came before has been recast into a new light. Big things are coming after. Appropriate time to execute the end of a social conflict plot within the seeker group (Susan argues with Lucas about his continued investigation of Marco's death despite her wishes).}*

Susan tries to celebrate her findings with Lucas, but he knows Susan is unhappy about the state of things. Susan keeps drinking. She suggests moving to Oceania together. She falls asleep, and Lucas carries her home. While she is asleep, Lucas searches through her home, for more information about Marco. Suddenly, an alien looking organism stands in front of Susan's bed, in the shape of Susan. Lucas calls Susan awake. The organism disappears, runs inside Susan. She wakes up. Lucas tells her about what just happened; they both realise the implications. Susan has contracted the disease, and the disease produces the organisms that Marco was talking about. 

Upon realising that Lucas is still investigating Marco's death against her wishes, Susan breaks down ([[Susan breakdown]]). At the end when they reconcile, she suggests again escaping to Oceania, publish their findings, receive help from the advanced medicine there, and putting everything behind them. This time, Lucas agrees. 
## Part 3 - The City's Darkness
##### Escape
Lucas and Susan make the preparations to escape Eurasia. Patricia encourages Lucas to bring Susan to her, so she can help change their identities and live a new life. But Lucas knows this isn't an option. The Enlightenment Society suggests Lucas not to leave. 

On the continental express, Lucas and Susan discuss life. Susan asks Lucas if he ever had to deal with loss. Lucas shares a violent event that happened during primary school, which resulted in the majority of the class to die. His teacher, Miss Liam, alone saved him, but appeared to be critically injured herself. The Eurasian Federation gave him free housing and education. He had never seen Miss Liam again, and assumed she was dead. When asked if he remembers anything about her, he says it was her orange-scented perfume. Susan was amazed that he never told her about this in highschool. Lucas explained that he continued not to tell anyone till this day because he didn't want people to assume he was traumatised or fucked up, or have to tip toe around him - it would have made relationships very awkward, because people didn't know how to handle such stories. Susan says that he maybe should have just talked to them, and saw how they respond. Lucas asks what if it made them run away? Susan says that a relationship in which you can't communicate your true thoughts, is not worth being in. Besides, she is still here, isn't she? And she isn't about to treat him any differently. 

Susan notices how this is very nostalgic, as if she has experienced it before. She hints at a relationship with Lucas that is wiped from memory, during the time period when they were placed under soft house arrest following Marco's death. 
##### Despair Stage
*{The Conspiracy makes an active move against the seeker, and utterly crush them (Use the Eurasian secret police to capture and interrogate them, and killing Susan). Their companions die (Susan, not before revealing that she deduced the disease is transmitted by a song, and is the cause of the end of the world war). The mole reveals themselves (Patricia).}*

**The secret police capture Lucas and Susan** at the edge of the Eurasian continent, and bring them into the Eurasian Nucleus for interrogation of treason. After a harsh interrogation, Susan reveals how the disease is spread. **Susan deduces that the Flowerhead disease is spread by a song**. She also suspects that the song has **origins from Satellite 6, and is what ended the world war** - she deduces this through the genetic records of the Eurasian population - there was way higher percentage of deafness in the population right after the war, so the end of the war must had been a selection event for that trait. Patricia tries to bring both Susan and Lucas away, but Alma intercepts and takes Lucas. Alma speaks to Lucas about his journey, while Patricia brings Susan to her home. Alma tells Lucas that mistakes can be forgiven, and tells him of her own investigations - that whatever he has been involved with, is not the real Enlightenment Society - the real one went defunct decades ago. 

Lucas realises things aren't as they seem exactly, but can't trust Alma fully. While Alma asks him for everything he knows, he faces the agonising choice of siding with Patricia or Alma. He decides to protect Patricia. He made the wrong choice. He tells Alma he wants to go see Susan, and visit Patricia; Alma lets him. 

Lucas later goes to Patricia. In a twist, Patricia revels it was her that notified the secret police, and that she was the leader of a conspiracy all along, separate from the government. **Patricia kills Susan** for fear that she knows how to stop the conspiracy, having lived together with Marco. Before passing, Susan asks if Patricia or the government took her memories, if she and Lucas had already investigated into the conspiracy's secret in the past, to which Patricia replies it is just a side effect of the disease; this makes Susan very sad. 

Lucas watches Patricia play the song to Susan, who dies immediately. When Lucas kneels beside Susan, he notices how her black dress glistens in the light. Patricia explains her world view and plan to Lucas, how **seeing all the information that suggests humanity's one way ticket to extinction has turned her hopeless, and the only hope is a peaceful transcendence of humanity into the frequency domain**, drawing an analogy to euthanising the dying, and she plans to do it by **playing the song to everyone through the continental speaker network that Lucas and Marco had been helping to build.** She asks him to join her. He doesn't answer, so she places him on house arrest at an unknown apartment, sends a resignation letter to the DAP, erasing his existence. She says she likes him as a talent and would hope he turns around to the plan one day. Lucas is allowed to bury Susan at a location of his choice, accompanied by guards. 
## Part 4 - A Song for all Mankind 
##### Revelation
*{Seeker has the final, most important piece of enlightenment (Marco's secret is alien civilisations hiding between the stars). Knows how to defeat the Conspiracy (Must contact them). Seeker sets it in motion (Deliver the coords of Satellite 6 to the Factory Array).}*

Lucas speaks with the Susan in his memory, asking whether he would see her in the frequency domain. 

Patricia places a catatonic Lucas in an apartment in a new city, with guards watching him. Through the news, Lucas knows that the continental speaker network is due to complete construction in a week. The guards comment how the workers at the construction sites are all part of the conspiracy. **The DAP** catches on that Lucas' resignation is suspicious, and **declares it an anomaly** for everyone to investigate. They visit the regional governments and pinpoint Lucas to one particular city. Eventually they locate Lucas in his building. 

Lucas spends all his days watching tv during the day, and gazing out the window at night. One night, he sees a star blink. This reminds him of the first case he solved - the mystery of the blinking star. He looks down, sees people phasing in and out of the city lights, and has an epiphany. He remembers seeing Susan's dress, and her wallet containing Marco's final poem for her. He remembers telling a conspiracy theorist they have no idea what they are talking about. He remembers Susan, mostly importantly telling him "you just need to talk". Looking at the blinking star, he realises he had the final piece of the puzzle all along; he now understands - just as Marco had - a secret that embraced all modern history. 

Lambda contemplates his life. He regrets the latter half of his academic career, where he did nothing but to push papers and keep his inconsequential research alive; where his research was consequential, he was working towards humanity's doom. Through Susan's enthusiasm, he remembers his original motive for becoming a scientist - to protect the happiness of mankind. He notified the world science society of a disease and the doomsday song, hoping people smarter than him can figure out a way to reverse the effects, but just before he can explain Patricia's conspiracy, Patricia shows up behind him and destroys his radio. Lambda tells her throughout the decades, the times they spent together were his fondest memories; he persuades her to abandon the conspiracy, since there are still more memories to be made on earth. She doesn't respond, but embraces him and plays the song to send him to the frequency domain. She predicts that the World Science Foundation will not discover a way to reverse the song. She is right. 

Lucas requests to bring his collection of movies so he can watch them; the guards do so. Among them is the recorded tv segment of Lucas presenting the discovery of Satellite 6. the guards think he has gone crazy, indulging in himself, watching it over and over. Two days before the completion of the continental speaker network, a friend from the DAP has finally found Lucas, and can communicate with him through a precision sonar device from afar; Lucas communicates back via random body gestures dictated by the friend. Lucas tells the friend to try to stop the construction and to manufacture ear shields at the Factory Array. The friend does so. Shortly after, the Factory Array sends drones to outside Lucas' window, but gets shot down by the guards before it can initiate communication. 

Patricia catches the friend, because the Factory Array reported them; she brings them to Lucas, and kills the friend in front of him. Lucas sees on tv how the DAP gets arrested for trying to sabotage the continental speaker array. She explains how there is nothing he can do, and he should give up just as she has - then there will be no pain. 

Lucas agrees to work with Patricia, to accelerate the completion of the speaker network, so that he can see Susan in the frequency domain. When meeting the Factory Array this time, Lucas sees that even the Factory Array was part of the conspiracy. However, he quickly notices that it's just pretending. The Factory Array tells him, that when Marco learned the truth about the world, he laughed. It always had a hard time understanding him, but Marco explained that hearing the truth was funny in a sad way. The Factory Array expresses sadness about most problems in the world being caused by information asymmetry, and blockades, where information cannot travel from one place to another for various reasons. Jokes are a form of encryption, and the Factory Array wants to laugh. And Lucas has the joke. The Factory Array asks Lucas what part of his apartment was funny. Lucas is shocked that the drones were sent by the Factory Array. Lucas said the television. The Factory Array thanks Lucas, for thanks to him, everything has fallen in place. 
##### Final Showdown
*{The final showdown where the seeker defeats the Conspiracy. The biggest twists of the story executed here (Patricia is Miss Liam; Lucas' major realisations; Lucas put Susan's body in the cryogenic vaults).}*

The day arrives, the speaker construction is complete; Patricia commands the conspiracy to play the song. All of humanity falls asleep; their consciousness transferred to the frequency domain. 

In the frequency domain, a few major things happen:
1. Humans greet those original people at the world war period. 
2. Susan meets Marco. 
3. The Eurasian Nucleus, Alma, Patricia, discuss the philosophy of rule. 
4. Patricia remembers her years of service to Eurasia, how Lucas was the one she did it for. She imagines herself being welcomed to a reunion. Lucas' primary school class, all grown up. It turns out **Patricia was Miss Liam all along**. 

Lucas meets Patricia in the frequency domain. He points out how Patricia's goals were never for the totality of mankind, but herself - she wanted to reunite with the students, most of whom she was unable to save. Patricia protected Lucas throughout the story, because he was one of them. 

Outside, Alma and some DAP agents are still standing - they deliberately injured their ears to make themselves deaf. They realise that the Factory Array is the only entity that will still be awake other than themselves, so they go to it. 

Lucas reveals why Patricia killed Marco - because he was the only one that truly had something that could stop her conspiracy. He explains that the "ghosts between the city lights" Marco spoke of are actually **alien civilisations hiding in between the stars**, that show up as dark matter. He deduces that the boltzmann noise on the original spacetime channel were actually the communications between these aliens. And that the doomsday song's true origin was the alien civilisations. 

Marco shows up and explains that it was the **first half of a promise** that humanity was unable to fulfill. **The Factory Array has been searching, for the coordinates of Satellite 6**, so it can establish communication with the aliens and declare that humanity was now a peaceful species. An inverse song would then be sent back, reversing the effects of the original doomsday song. Back when the Factory Array sent drones to Lucas, the only important part was that it could see Lucas' tv screen, where he played the segment during which he deduced that the blinking star was Satellite 6. The Factory Array, upon receiving it, internally thanked Lucas - that thanks to him, everything has fallen into place. 

Patricia's plans will be destroyed, and she falls to her knees. She begs Lucas to come sit beside her, on her death bed. 

DAP plays the song at various nodes of the speaker network. Members of the World Science Foundation that made themselves deaf contacts them, to help play the song in their own regions. The world begins to wake up. 

Susan is glad to be with Marco, but he tells her she must go and live a good life with Lucas - Susan's form is phasing away from the frequency domain, presumably back to the world. Susan is confused because her body would have decayed long ago. Marco tells her that someone must had preserved it. We see that Lucas had put her body in the abandoned cryogenic vaults. Furthermore, Susan's memories with Lucas are real, but not because they happened in the past, but that they happen in the future. 
## Epilogue - Stars on the Ground are City Lights
##### New World
*{The new state of the world after the events of the story.}*
People are waking up in their homes. The streets are filled with car crashes but otherwise empty. Lucas goes to the abandoned cryogenic vault to find Susan. They walk together into the city lights. From that point on in history, aliens were never seen again in Eurasia.
