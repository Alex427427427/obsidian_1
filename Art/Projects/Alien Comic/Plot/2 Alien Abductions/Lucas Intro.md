___
The scene can take place in a **crowded town square or meeting hall** where the Alien Research Society of Eurasia is gathered, along with local townspeople, discussing the recent alleged abductions. The conspiracy theorist is in the middle of delivering a passionate speech about alien abductions, and tensions are high. People are murmuring, buying into the panic, and Lucas is standing at the back of the crowd, blending in.

**Narrative Setup:**

- As the conspiracy theorist points out all the strange occurrences, he dramatically points to Lucas, describing him as a "suspicious-looking man" with a trench coat and glasses, possibly connected to the government or the aliens.

**Lucas' Introduction:**

1. **First Line of Dialogue:** The crowd turns to look at Lucas, expecting him to deny it or react defensively. Instead, Lucas, completely unfazed, steps forward and deadpans:
    
    - _"Well, if I were an alien, I probably wouldn’t choose such a public disguise."_ He pauses, scanning the crowd. _"But it does keep the rain out."_ (referring to his trench coat).
2. **Reaction to His Humor:** The crowd is unsure how to react—some laugh nervously, others remain confused. Lucas doesn't wait for a response and casually flips open his government ID, introducing himself:
    
    - _"Lucas. Department of Abnormal Phenomena. Here to investigate. Any objections?"_
    
    This shows his confidence and no-nonsense approach while sprinkling in his dry humor.
    
3. **Professionalism and Insight:** While still maintaining his calm demeanor, Lucas immediately starts taking charge of the investigation:
    
    - He questions the conspiracy theorist calmly, but with a hint of sarcasm:
        - _"So, you say aliens took you? Did they leave a forwarding address?"_
    - He scans the crowd for reactions, watching everyone closely, subtly analyzing their responses without breaking his cool.
4. **Revealing His Methodical Side:** After dealing with the conspiracy theorist, Lucas speaks quietly to the town's mayor or police officer, clearly already several steps ahead:
    
    - _"Let's assume the abductions are as real as the Easter Bunny. What’s more interesting is who’s benefitting from the story.”_
    
    He delivers this line with a smirk, hinting that he’s skeptical about the aliens but fully focused on the human motives behind the chaos in the town.
    

### Why This Works:

- **Showcases Lucas’ dry humor** without being over-the-top: His humor is understated and deadpan, with an intellectual edge. He’s not there to entertain but can’t help throwing out quips when the situation gets too ridiculous.
- **Establishes his competence**: By immediately deflating the conspiracy theorist’s claims and moving toward a rational explanation, Lucas is positioned as a capable investigator who doesn’t buy into the town’s hysteria.
- **Highlights his unflappable nature**: In the face of suspicion, Lucas remains calm and even turns it into a joke. Nothing seems to rattle him.
