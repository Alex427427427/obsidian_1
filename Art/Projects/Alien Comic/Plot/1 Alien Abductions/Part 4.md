It is *quartz* that gives Lucas a sudden epiphany. (In part 3 Lucas gets brought to the quartz by Anya. Talking about the man who fell from the sky.)

Lucas brings everyone there, explains that the murder weapon is quartz, which was later given to Anya and already turned into rings. 

Police Chief: "Listen, kid. You want justice? You find a time machine and stop him from wanderin’ off into the woods. Otherwise…" (gestures vaguely) "…chalk it up to bad luck."


Lucas asks Viktor to take off his scarf. At this point Viktor jumps out and admits. Tries to say he killed Elena's father. 

Lucas uses Elena's ring to prove that Elena was the one who dealt the killing blow. 

Lucas: "Viktor, stop. You're not the one that killed Elena's father. He was twice your weight, on top of you, strangling you."

"Did you know that quartz is strong enough to cut into Aluminium?"

"Elena. The Aluminium ring you wore means so much to you that you didn't take it off after that horrible night. So I'm sure you're still wearing it now. Would you like to show everyone? The chips on your ring that I felt... when you held my hand?"

Elena shakes. 

Viktor explodes in anger at Lucas. 

Elena tells him to stop. She says that her father deserved to die. But she killed him, so she also deserves punishment. Whenever she thought about having killed her father, she was happy.
