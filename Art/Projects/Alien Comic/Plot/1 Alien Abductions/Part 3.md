___
Lucas calls the local authorities. Lucas checks the corpse. The back of the head is caved in, and the hands are missing. Upon shining a flashlight on the wound, the wound glistens. Is the blood glistening? No murder weapons are found in the area. 
___
The four people that claim to be abducted, are now suspects. Elena is too broken to be interviewed, so Lucas starts with Anya. What he wants to know is, why each of the four people lied about being abducted. 

**Anya**: (happy to see him but also sad) “Ahhh, Mr. Yang. I’m sorry things turned out this way.”

**Lucas**: “No, the apology is mine.”

**Anya**: (shrugs) “Guess I shouldn’t have played along with the whole abduction thing. I was just trying to stir things up, get people talking, you know? But all it did was attract a bunch of nutjobs… and you.”

**Lucas**: “Well, I’m here now.”

**Anya**: (with a light smile) “While you’re here, why don’t you take a look at these new rings I made?” (She gestures to a tray of beautifully crafted quartz rings) “Got a girl on your mind? These would make a great gift. Quartz—coated so they don’t chip as easily.”

**Lucas**: (glancing at the rings, not engaging) “Thanks, but I’m not interested in quartz. Do you make aluminum rings?”

**Anya**: (feigning disappointment) “Aluminum? Really? Surely someone working for the government can afford a *proper* ring.”

**Lucas**: (with a subtle smirk) “I’m just curious. Has anyone purchased an Aluminium ring from you recently?”

**Anya**: (sighs and reaches for her record book) “Let me check...” (She flips through the pages, her tone becoming more serious as she scans the names) “Viktor...”

**Lucas**: (leaning in) “Viktor? When was that?”

**Anya**: (glancing up, a teasing glint returning to her eyes) “Oh, just a few days ago...”

**Lucas**: (ignoring her bait, focused) “Can I take a copy of that page?”

**Anya**: (smirking) “Sure. And if you ever change your mind about those rings... I could help you find something a little more personal.”

**Lucas**: (straightening up) “I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks.”
___
**Viktor**: "How's Elena?"

**Lucas**: "She's too distressed to be interviewed."

Lucas deduces that Viktor and Elena are in love, because Elena is wearing an Aluminium ring that Viktor bought from Anya. They hide their nightly visits to the forest under alien abduction, so they won't be found out. 

Viktor admits being engaged to Elena, but asks Lucas to keep it a secret. 
___
The conspiracy theorist has been camping outside the old man's house, and tells Lucas that the old man visits the forest at night. 

___
