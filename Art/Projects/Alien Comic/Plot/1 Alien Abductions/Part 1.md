Title drop - "There are no Aliens in Eurasia" "Chapter 1 - Alien Abductions" 
___
Day. Community center of Vyshkanov. A small crowd gathers. There is a long table, with "Alien Research Society of Eurasia" banner hung above. The representatives are at a table covered with odd gadgets, strange alien memorabilia, and a UFO-shaped coffee mug. They’re overly enthusiastic, almost comically so, as they interview the claimants.

**Elena**: (Nervously) “I—I woke up in the forest. My father was next to me. It was dark but… I thought I saw a shadow. Maybe a person.” 

**ARSE B**: (Interrupting, holding up a toy alien figure) “Damn! Did it look like this? Or maybe like this?” 

**Viktor**: (Frowning) “This isn’t a joke. Her father is still missing.”

**ARSE A**: (Waving a hand dismissively) “Hey! Wait your turn. (Back to Elena) Was there a smell of… extraterrestrial essence?”

**Elena**: (Voice trembling) “I can’t explain it. It felt real. But my father—he just saw the shadow and ran."

**ARSE A**: (Smiling brightly) “Alright, alright, I think we’ve got enough. We’ll call you if we need anything else.”

**Elena**: (Standing up, upset) “Wait—”

**ARSE B**: (Cheerfully) “Don’t worry, I'm sure there’s a perfectly alien explanation!”

Elena exits, visibly shaken. Viktor gives her a concerned look as she leaves the room.


**ARSE A**: (Excitedly) “So, Anya, while you were being abducted, did you see any unusual lights or perhaps, a UFO?”

**Anya**: (Maintaining a stern expression) “No UFOs. Just a light when I woke up - and some quartz nearby.”

**ARSE B**: (Giggling) “Quartz! How fascinating! Was it glowing? Did it communicate with you? Maybe it was a signal from the aliens!”

**Anya**: (Annoyed) “No, just quartz. Regular, valuable quartz. I thought it might be of interest to—”

**ARSE B**: (Stepping in, dryly) “Ahhh, valuable indeed! Dismissed.” 



**ARSE B**: (Leaning in eagerly) “Now, who was that rude man from before?"

**Viktor**: "I'm Viktor."

**ARSE A**: "Tell us about your experience, Viktor. Did you see any aliens or extraterrestrial technology?”

**Viktor**: (Nervously) “Nothing, actually. Just woke up in the forest.” 

**Yelena**: (Interrupting) “Did you notice anything suspicious in the forest or around town?”

**Viktor**: (Shaking his head) “When I was running out of the forest, I might've seen something unusual, but I forgot. Something or someone that shouldn't be there at that hour.”

**ARSE B**: "Amazing. That provides absolutely no information."

**ARSE A**: "Hey, it could've been an alien."



**David**: (Leaning forward eagerly, rubbing his hands together) “Now, for the real show! I've done my investigations. I’ve got theories!”

**ARSE A**: (Interrupting, as she starts to shuffle through her alien-themed papers) “Yes, David, we know you have theories. But do you have proof? Or are you just gonna make shit up?” 

**David**: (Playfully) “Just hear me out! I wouldn't have called you guys here if there was nothing. This town was built solely for the abandoned space program, right? You know what that means? Government secrets! There have been some strange objects hovering over that forest lately. What do you think they could be?"

**ARSE B**: "UFOs?"

**David**: "Exactly! You see, the government says they abandoned the space program, but that's a lie. They are hiding aliens in these forests. The aliens and the Eurasian government are plotting to take over the world together! Like the Illuminati!" 

**ARSE A**: "Slow down, slow down. Do you remember your own abduction? Or have any footage of these UFOs?"

**ARSE B**: "Yeah, you seem a bit too excited about being abducted. Who's to say you didn't abduct these people and orchestrate this whole thing?"

**David**: "Wait wait wait, what is this friendly fire? I have evidence to back it up. Look, I even recorded the UFOs."

He shows the ARSE reps the video of the flying objects above the forest. 

**ARSE A**: "Wow, this could be huge."

**David**: "Of course! In fact, if you ask me, the real suspicious person... (Pointing dramatically at Lucas, who is standing in the corner, blending into the background) Is that man over there! I've never seen him around here. Look at his glasses, his trench coat, his suitcase! And that typical East-Eurasian hair reeking of conformity. That’s a secret agent if I’ve ever seen it!” 

By this point, David has gotten within inches from Lucas' face. 

**Lucas**: "Well, if I wanted to keep my identity secret, I probably wouldn't choose such a suggestive attire. Though it does keep the snow out."

**ARSE A**: "Suspicious visitor, identify yourself!" 

**Lucas**: (taking out his watch) "Lucas Yang. Department of Abnormal Phenomena."

The crowd gasps, Lucas is from the Eurasian government. 

**Lucas**: "I was called here... By your local jeweler."

**David**: "Anya?"

**Lucas**: (looking at ARSE) "But it seems like someone else arrived first."

**David**: "That's right. We the Alien Research Society of Eurasia, never fails to respond to alien troubles. That's why we are widely known and respected."

**Lucas**: "Of course. I'm sure you leave behind an impression wherever you go."

**Lucas**: "But I must say, your interviews were cringe worthy. You disrespectfully ignored Elena's missing father - which is the most pressing issue at hand. And you failed to make certain key observations." 

**ARSE B**: "Like what?"

**Lucas**: "That every person interviewed so far has red circular marks on their body. Elena's forearm, the back of Viktor's neck, and Anya's palms." 

**David**: "W-what?"

**Lucas**: "Except you, David."
