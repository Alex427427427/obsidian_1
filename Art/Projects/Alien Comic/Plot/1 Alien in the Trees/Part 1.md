Night. Starry sky. Trees. A strange looking wych elm. A body inside the wych elm. 

Title drop - "Abduction"

Day. Community center of Vyshkanov. A small crowd gathers. There is a long table, with "Alien Research Society of Eurasia" banner hung above. The representatives are at a table covered with odd gadgets, strange alien memorabilia, and a UFO-shaped coffee mug. They’re overly enthusiastic, almost comically so, as they interview the claimants.

**ARSE A**: (Excitedly, with wide eyes) “So, Elena, tell us all about your alien encounter! Was it a bright, shimmering light? Did you see any little green men?”

**Elena**: (Nervously) “I—I woke up in the forest. It was dark but… I thought I saw a shadow. Maybe a person. My father was next to me—” 

**ARSE B**: (Interrupting, holding up a toy alien figure) “Figures! Did it look like this? Or maybe like this?” (He makes a silly alien voice) “Take me to your leader!”

**Viktor**: (Frowning) “This isn’t a joke. This young lady here is deeply distressed. Her father is still missing!”

**ARSE A**: (Waving a hand dismissively) “Hey! Wait your turn. We'll get to you soon enough. Elena, tell us more about the shadow. Was there a smell of… extraterrestrial essence?”

**Elena**: (Voice trembling) “I can’t explain it. It felt real. But my father—”

**ARSE B**: (Leaning in with a dramatic flourish) “Your father! Did he communicate with the aliens? Maybe he made contact before the abduction!”

**Elena**: (Tears welling) “He didn’t communicate with anyone! He just… saw the thing and ran off.”

**ARSE A**: (Smiling brightly) “Alright, alright, I think we’ve got enough. You can step outside now, dear. We’ll call you if we need anything else.”

**Elena**: (Standing up, upset) “But I—”

**ARSE B**: (Cheerfully) “Don’t worry, we’re sure there’s a perfectly alien explanation!”

Elena exits, visibly shaken. Viktor gives her a concerned look as she leaves the room.



**ARSE A**: (Excitedly) “So, Irina, you’ve had quite the experience! Tell us about your abduction. Did you see any unusual lights or, perhaps, a UFO?”

**Irina**: (Maintaining a stern expression) “I didn’t see any UFOs. What I saw was a strange light in the forest, but I’m more concerned with the quartz I found nearby.”

**ARSE B**: (Giggling) “Quartz! How fascinating! Was it glowing? Did it communicate with you? Maybe it was a signal from the aliens!”

**Irina**: (Annoyed) “No, it wasn’t glowing or communicating. It’s just quartz. Valuable quartz. I found it near the site where the light was seen. I thought it might be of interest, but—”

**ARSE A**: (Interrupting, excitedly) “Ah, quartz! Alien crystals! There’s a theory that extraterrestrials use quartz for communication. Did you notice anything special about the quartz?”

**Irina**: (Frustrated) “It’s ordinary quartz. I’m a jeweler, not a conspiracy theorist. I merely reported what I found because it might be valuable.”

**ARSE B**: (Stepping in, dryly) “Perhaps the only thing extraordinary about the quartz is its potential market value in Eurasia. You're dismissed!” 

**Irina**: (Standing up, relieved) “Good. I have work to do.”



**ARSE B**: (Leaning in eagerly) “Now, who was that rude man from before?"

**Viktor**: "I'm Viktor."

**ARSE A**: "Tell us about your experience. Did you see any aliens or extraterrestrial technology?”

**Viktor**: (Nervously) “I saw nothing, actually. I just woke up in the forest.” 

**Yelena**: (Interrupting) “By yourself? Did you see any of the other abducted people?”

**Viktor**: (Confused and flustered) “No. If I saw other people I wouldn't have been as scared as I was.” 

**Yelena**: (Nodding) “Interesting. And did you notice anything suspicious in the forest or around town?”

**Viktor**: (Shaking his head) “When I was running out of the forest, I might've seen something unusual, but I forgot. Something that shouldn't be there at that hour.”

**ARSE B**: "Amazing. That provided absolutely no information."

**ARSE A**: "Hey, it could be an alien."

**Nikolai**: (Leaning forward eagerly, rubbing his hands together) “Now, for the real evidence! I’ve got theories! I saw the lights, I know the history of this town. I know-”

**ARSE A**: (Interrupting, as she starts to shuffle through her alien-themed papers) “Yes, Nikolai, we know you have theories. But do you have proof? Or are you just gonna make shit up?” 

**ARSE B**: (Playfully) “Proof, shmoof! It’s all about the experience. But we’ll hear you out!”

**Nikolai**: "This town was built solely for the abandoned space program. You know what that means? Government secrets! Have you not seen strange flying objects above that forest in the past few days? What do you think they could be?"

**ARSE B**: "UFOs?"

**Nikolai**: "Exactly! The answer is simple. The Eurasian government is studying aliens in these forests. They never stopped! They say they abandoned the space program, but that's just to give us a false sense of security. There are aliens in the forest! They abducted us, so they could experiment on us, and do unspeakable things to us. The aliens and the Eurasian government are plotting to take over the world together!" 

**ARSE A**: "Slow down. Do you remember any of these abductions? Or have any footage of these UFOs?"

**ARSE B**: "Yeah, not gonna lie, you seem kind of suspicious. And a bit too excited about being abducted. Who's to say you didn't abduct these people and orchestrate this whole thing?"

**Nikolai**: "Wait wait wait, of course I have evidence to back it up. Look, I even recorded the UFOs."

He shows the ARSE reps the video of the flying objects above the forest. 

**ARSE A**: "Wow, this is huge."

**Nikolai**: "Of course! In fact, if you ask me..."

**Nikolai**: (Pointing dramatically at Lucas, who is standing in the corner, blending into the background) “The most suspicious person is that man over there! I've never seen him around here. Look at his glasses, his trench coat, his suitcase. And that typical East-Eurasian hair reeking of conformity. That’s a secret agent if I’ve ever seen it!” 

By this point, Nikolai has gotten within inches from Lucas' face. 

**Lucas**: "Well, if I wanted to keep my identity secret, I probably wouldn't choose such an obvious attire. Though it does keep the snow out."

**ARSE A**: "Identify yourself." 

**Lucas**: (taking out his watch) "Lucas Yang. Department of Abnormal Phenomena."

The crowd gasps, Lucas is from the Eurasian government. 

**Lucas**: "And here I was hoping you could do part of the investigation for me. But your method is cringe-worthy. You dismissed the most important issue at hand - namely, Elena's missing father. And you failed to make important observations"

**ARSE B**: "Like what?"

**Lucas**: "Every person interviewed so far has red, circular marks on their body. It seems that the abduction victims have something done to their bodies." 

**Nikolai**: "W-what?"

**Lucas**: "Except you, Nikolai." 

**Nikolai**: "What are you suggesting?"

**Lucas**: (shrugging) "I'm not sure myself. Perhaps you were never abducted. Perhaps you're not as important to the aliens as the rest. And as for the UFOs you saw... (takes out his suitcase) I own one. This is a standard land surveying drone from the Factory Array. How can you call yourself an investigator when you fail to do basic research on the simplest explanations?"
