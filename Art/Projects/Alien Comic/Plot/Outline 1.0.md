## Important to Keep in Mind
The hook of the story - the promise set by the premise to the reader - you must deliver them. Frequently remind with the phrase "there are no aliens in Eurasia."
**Illuminati; conspiracy theorists; aliens.**
## Part 1 - The Department of Abnormal Phenomena
##### Begin with Microcosm of the Story, Set Expectations, Introduce Cast
*{Show the reader "this is a story about conspiracies, illuminati, aliens".}*
##### Inciting Incident
*{A slip up in the Conspiracy's otherwise perfect plan (Marco's death).}*
##### The First threshold
*{Seeker pulls on the first thread that reveals how deep and big the Conspiracy is, and alludes to what it is all about (Marco's clue "Look for the ghosts between the city lights").}*
## Part 2 - The Disease and the Aliens
##### Main Investigation Stage
*{Seeker gains information (look for aliens, finds Illuminati), encounters resistance from the Conspiracy (avoidance -> distraction -> intimidation).}*
##### Turning Point 
*{The plot has a major twist (Aliens are the disease). Everything that came before has been recast into a new light. Big things are coming after. Appropriate time to execute the end of a social conflict plot within the seeker group (Susan argues with Lucas about his continued investigation of Marco's death despite her wishes).}*
## Part 3 - The City's Darkness
##### Escape
Lucas and Susan make the preparations to escape Eurasia.
##### Despair Stage
*{The Conspiracy makes an active move against the seeker, and utterly crush them (Use the Eurasian secret police to capture and interrogate them, and killing Susan).

## Part 4 - A Song for all Mankind 
##### Revelation
*{Seeker has the final, most important piece of enlightenment (Marco's secret is alien civilisations hiding between the stars). Knows how to defeat the Conspiracy (Must contact them). Seeker sets it in motion (Deliver the coords of Satellite 6 to the Factory Array).}*
##### Final Showdown
