Lucas calls the local authorities. Lucas checks the corpse. The back of the head is caved in, and the hands are missing. Upon shining a flashlight on the wound, the wound glistens. Is the blood glistening? No murder weapons are found in the area. 

The four people that claim to be abducted, are now suspects. Elena is too broken to be interviewed, so Lucas starts with Anya. What he wants to know is, why each of the four people lied about being abducted. 

**Anya**: (happy to see him but also sad) "Ahhh, Mr Yang. I'm sorry things turned out this way."

**Lucas**: "No, the apology is mine."

Lucas confronts Anya about her story. She admits that she was just playing into the abduction story to try to garner wider attention. But it didn't work, because the alien story only attracted nutjobs, and Lucas. 

**Anya**: "While you're here, why don't you take a look at these new rings I made? Got a girl on your mind? These beautiful quartz rings will make for a great gift. I've coated over them, so they don't chip as easily."

**Lucas**: "Thanks, but I'm not interested in quartz. Do you make Aluminium rings?" 

**Anya**: "Aluminium? Surely someone working for the government can afford a proper ring."

**Lucas**: "Has anyone purchased one from you in the past few days?"

**Anya**: "Let me see..." 

Lucas receives a book record from Anya. He sees the name Viktor. 
___
**Viktor**: "How's Elena?"

**Lucas**: "She's too distressed to be interviewed."

Lucas deduces that Viktor and Elena are in love, because Elena is wearing an Aluminium ring that Viktor bought from Anya. They hide their nightly visits to the forest under alien abduction, so they won't be found out. 

Viktor admits being engaged to Elena, but asks Lucas to keep it a secret.
