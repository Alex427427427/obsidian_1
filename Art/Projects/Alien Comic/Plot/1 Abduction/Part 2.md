**David**: "What are you suggesting?"

**Lucas**: (shrugging) "You tell me. Perhaps you were never abducted. Perhaps you're not as important to the aliens as the others. And as for the UFOs you saw... (takes out his suitcase) I own one. This is a standard land surveying drone from the Factory Array. How can you call yourself an investigator when you fail to do basic research?"

David takes a look at the drone, then back at his recording, frowning. 

**Lucas**: (packing up, prepares to leave) "And here I was hoping you could do some of the work for me."

**David**: "Wait! W-what do you suggest we do now?"

**Lucas**: "Search for Elena's father, of course!" 
___
Lucas finds Elena. He introduces himself and shakes Elena's hand. Elena wears an Aluminium ring. 

Lucas obtains info about Elena's father's appearance, and promises Elena to find him.
___
David and the ARSE members follow Lucas towards the forest. 

**David**: "We already searched for two days. This forest is huge. He's probably in some secret lab, being experimented on." 

Lucas opens his suitcase and sends his surveying drone over the forest. 

**ARSE A**: "There's no use. Dead or alive, you won't be able to see him from above the forest. Otherwise all those land surveying drones would've seen something." 

**Lucas**: "If he's still alive, there should be heat signature."

The drone has spotted something. Lucas prepares to go find it. The rest refuse to enter the forest. 
___
Lucas arrives at the place. An old man yells at him from above. 

**Mr Tree**: "HEY! What the hell are you doing here? (points to Lucas) are you from the government?"

**Lucas**: "I'm from the Department of-."

**Mr Tree**: "I've seen your drones! I know you're planning to cut this area down! Don't even think about touching these trees. They're my children!"

**Lucas**: "Okay, okay! I'm not touching your trees. I'm just here to investigate alien abductions."

**Mr Tree**: "Huh? I can't really hear you! invest in what?"

**Lucas**: "Investigating! Alien! Abductions! A missing person!"

**Mr Tree**: "Aliens? You guys must be bored. A-CHOO!" 

**Lucas**: "Watch out!"

Mr Tree falls, Lucas's drone catches him. The drone drops Mr Tree to the floor. 

**Lucas**: "Have you seen a large man around here? Do you know Elena's father?" 

Mr Tree has not seen anyone. But knows that someone has carved strange symbols into the trees. Mr Tree expresses hatred towards Elena's father, for bragging about soon getting rich. 
___
Lucas follows the strange symbols, and the forest is so thick that it is dark now. He arrives at a wych elm. Inside is the body of Elena's father.
