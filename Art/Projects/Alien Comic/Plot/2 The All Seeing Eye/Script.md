## Part 1
**Lucas**: I've never met anyone else like Marco Korolev. 

**Lucas**: He was a different kind of conspiracy theorist - his ideas did not make him hate or distrust the world. Instead, they made him fall in love with it. To him, everything was a grand mystery. A promise of adventure. He lived passionately and studied furiously. Ever since I've known him in university, he had been obsessed with aliens. 

**Lucas**: Even I got swept along sometimes. 

**Lucas**: He found in me someone that would entertain his ideas, and I liked the positive energy he brought, so I welcomed his friendship. Deep down, I knew nothing would come of his mad investigations. Because the truth is - 

**Title drop - There are no Aliens in Eurasia**
**Chapter 1 - The All-Seeing Eye**

**Lucas**: By graduation, he wasn't academically gifted enough to go into astrophysics, so he took a job at the Factory Array, where his wits allowed him to quickly climb the ranks to lead engineer. 

**Lucas**: I applied to work at the government. 

**Lucas**: He still tried to get me involved in developing his alien theories, but I grew annoyed. Through subtle hints, I made my annoyance known. I was ready to move on from his childish pursuits. 

**Lucas**: Eventually, Marco stopped. 

**Lucas**: Months turned into years, and now... 

**Lucas**: I haven't felt excited or curious about anything for a long time. 

Lucas is walking through the Factory Array. 

**Lucas**: Why am I suddenly thinking about Marco now? 

**Lucas**: Maybe because I feel sorry for not keeping in touch. 

**Lucas**: Maybe because he recently tried to contact me again, saying he discovered something big. 

**Lucas**: Maybe because the crime scene I'm walking towards is Marco's office. 
## Part 2
*Wide panel: The bustling **Factory Array** at dusk. The industrial complex is alive with noise and motion—towering machines, workers moving between the giant structures.* 

**Narration: Despite the noise and activity, there was an eerie emptiness to the Factory Array, like a colossal machine that never stopped but had no soul.**

*A man stands just outside the gate, his face partially shadowed by his glasses. He’s isolated in the middle of this overwhelming sprawl, as though the world itself is keeping him at a distance.*

*He steps through the gate of the Factory Array, moving with quiet determination. He brushes past workers who barely glance at him. The noise of machinery and the hum of the central system surrounds him, but the man walks in silence, as if separated from it all by an invisible barrier. His hands are shoved deep in his trench coat pockets, and his eyes don’t stray from his path.* 

*He walks towards an office which has yellow and black tapes taped across the corridor, on both sides of the office door. The tapes say "crime scene - do not enter". Outside the tape, police interview workers. As the man crosses the tape, a senior officer comes up.* 

Officer: "Sir. This area is restricted."

Man, holding up his watch: "I'm from the Department of Abnormal Phenomena." 

*The man is allowed to enter the room.*
 
**Narration: Lucas Yang was dispatched here, because on this day, something inexplicable happened. An abnormality.**

**Narration: Among this restless fractal network of machines that sprawled across the Eurasian Continent, one cog - one person - stopped.**

Lucas: "Marco..."

*When Lucas enters the room, he sees a clean sterile room with an office desk, illuminated by the full sized window behind it, some books and control panels, and, in the middle of it all - a man sleeping peacefully in his chair.*

Officer: "Marco Korolev. Lead engineer of this branch. The door was locked when they found him." 

**Narration: Some people collected money and status, and others collected friends. Lucas collected cases, which happened to be easier to hold onto.**

*Lucas walks towards Marco and the coroner examining him.*

Coroner: "I see no signs of struggle."

Lucas: "Time of death?"

Coroner: "It's hard to define... His heart was still beating when I arrived, but the brain was already dead."

Lucas: "Why didn't you put him on life support?"

Coroner: "We didn't have enough time. His heart stopped within minutes."

Lucas, thinking: If his heart had been delivering blood and oxygen to everywhere in his body, then no one could know how long ago the brain death happened.

*Lucas examines Marco's corpse.* 

Lucas, thinking: You look so peaceful. 

*Lucas looks up at the ventilation of the room.*

Lucas: "were there any gas leaks in this building?"

Officer: "No. If that was the case, the alarms would've gone off."

Coroner: "I've never seen anything like this. Everything about his body is normal. Like... whatever you call the thing controlling his brain... was just plucked out."

Lucas, thinking: How about that. You always said the world was full of mysteries. Now look at you... You've become one yourself. 

Lucas, thinking: If you were murdered, then the cause of death could've happened before this room was locked. Maybe a poisoned drink handed to you before you locked the room or... No. No gas leak or poison could've done this to you. 

*Marco only lays in his chair, eyes closed, still smiling, as if in a happy dream.* 

Lucas, thinking: I'm sorry. I don't have a clue what happened to you. Is this really going to be how it ends? Enlighten me, Marco. Just one more time. 

*Suddenly, Lucas notices that Marco's hand is pointing somewhere on the ground. It is a book titled "Novus Ordo Saeculorum" with a symbol of the all-seeing eye on it.*
