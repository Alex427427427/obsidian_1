**David**: "What are you suggesting?"

**Lucas**: (shrugging) "Maybe you were never abducted. And as for the 'UFOs' you saw... (takes out his suitcase) I own one. This is a standard land surveying drone from the Factory Array. How can you make your way through 16 years of the Eurasian education system without seeing one of these?"

David takes a look at the drone, then back at his recording, frowning. ARSE B also shamefully scratches his head. 

**Lucas**: (packing up, prepares to leave) "And here I was hoping you could do some of the work for me."

**ARSE B**: "Wait! W-what do you suggest we do now?"

**Lucas**: "Search for Elena's father, of course!" 
___
David and the ARSE members follow Lucas toward the forest, their flashlights bobbing in the dark. **Elena and Viktor** catch up to them, **Elena's face pale but determined.**

**Elena:** "If you’re looking for my father, I’m coming too."

**Viktor** (firmly): "So am I."

Lucas opens his suitcase and sends his surveying drone over the forest. 

**David**: "He's probably in some secret lab, being experimented on." 

**ARSE C**: "There's no use. Dead or alive, you won't be able to see him from above the forest. Otherwise all those land surveying drones would've seen something." 

**Viktor**: "We already searched for two days. This forest is huge. We just keep going around in circles." 

**Lucas**: "If he's still alive, there should be heat signature."

A tense silence follows as they watch the drone scan the forest. Then—

**Beep.**

Lucas’s eyes narrow as he studies the feed. Something **has** been detected. He starts forward. The others hesitate.

Lucas doesn’t stop. Elena and Viktor exchange glances before following him. The rest of the group lingers behind, muttering.
___
Lucas arrives at the place, but no person is found. An old man yells at him from above. 

**Mr Tree**: "HEY! What the hell are you doing here? (points to Lucas) is he from the government!?"

**Lucas**: "I'm from the Bureau of-."

**Mr Tree**: "I've seen your drones! I know you bastards are planning to cut this area down! Don't even think about touching these trees. They're my children!"

**ARSE B**: "Sir, we're not here to chop your trees. We're investigating alien abductions."

**Mr Tree**: "Huh? You're investing in what?"

**ARSE B**: "Investigating! Alien abductions! A missing person!"

**Mr Tree**: "Aliens? You guys must be bored. A-CHOO!" 

**Viktor**: "Watch out!"

Mr Tree loses his balance, Lucas's drone catches him midair. The drone drops Mr Tree to the ground. 

**Mr. Tree** (grumbling, brushing himself off): "Damn your machines..."

Lucas squats beside him.

**Lucas:** "Have you seen a large man around here? Elena’s father?"

**Mr. Tree:** "That bastard—Elena’s father—always running his mouth about getting rich soon. Maybe he found something he shouldn’t have."

Mr. Tree scowls but thinks. 

**Narration**: "The retired old man hasn't seen anyone come around here. But he has noticed strange symbols carved into his precious trees."
His lips curl in disgust.  

Elena **tenses.** The symbol seems to make her scared. Viktor places a hand on her shoulder. "You alright? No need to be scared. We're all here with you."

Lucas frowns. "There's more over here."

**David** (gulping): "Uh, the sun is setting. Maybe we should, you know, wait until morning?"
___
Lucas follows the strange symbols, and the forest is so thick that it is dark now. He arrives at a cave. Inside is the body of Elena's father. 

Lucas kneels down to examine the body. The hands are missing. The head is caved in at the back. He shines light on it, and sees something glittering. 

---
**Cut to: The town reacting. Authorities arrive.**

A police truck—its paint chipped, tires worn—pulls up near the cave entrance. Two officers step out, **one overweight and sluggish, the other reeking of cigarette smoke.** The town’s **so-called law enforcement.**

Police Chief (sighing, lighting a cigarette): "Alright, what’s the damn emergency now?"

Lucas gestures to the body of Elena’s father, still sprawled in the cave entrance. The Chief squints at the corpse but makes no move to approach.

Lucas: "A murder. Hands missing. Head caved in. Weapon not found."

ARSE C: "Might want to take a closer look. And isolate the scene from townsfolk."

The Chief exhales a slow puff of smoke.

Deputy: "Should we… uh, get the tape?"

The Chief gives him a look.

Police Chief: "And put it where? The trees? Hell, kid, half this town’s been in this forest at some point today."

ARSE C pinches the bridge of her nose.

ARSE C: "Fine. What about forensics?"

Deputy (awkwardly shifting): "Uh, our forensics guy is… well, we don’t have one."

Police Chief: "Last time we sent something for analysis, took six months. Report came back sayin’ the sample was 'probably dirt'." 

The town murmurs. Elena, standing nearby, clenches her fists. Lucas takes a deep breath.

ARSE A: "This town is hopeless."

Chief, patting A on his shoulder: "Welcome to Vyshkanov." 

**David (whispering to ARSE B):** "I told you. Secret lab."
**ARSE B:** "Dude, his head’s bashed in. Out in the middle of nowhere. There's no secret lab."

ARSE C: "Hey, badge boy, tell the police to do their job." Lucas just stands at the edge of the crowd, observing. ARSE C: "What are you doing?"

Lucas: "Everything's changed." 

ARSE C: "..."

Lucas: "We both came for alien abductions, but now have a murder on our hands."

Lucas: "And everyone that was "abducted" into the forest that night... are now first in line as suspects."
