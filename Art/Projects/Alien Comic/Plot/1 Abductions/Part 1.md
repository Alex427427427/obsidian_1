Narration: {Two years before the end.}

A man wearing glasses and a trench coat, carrying a suitcase, walks through the city lights. People hurry about. The man walks onto the train. Others are clearly wearing summer clothes. It is early morning, and many commuters stare at him. He takes the train through Eurasia.  

After the train stops, Lucas walks out of an empty train, into the strong cold winds of what seems to be a town near the mountains. 

Narration: {Lucas suspected there were aliens in Eurasia. In the summer of Ninety-Two, in the remote northern town of Vyshkanov, the search began.}

Night, forest. A woman (Elena later) is on the ground. 
**woman**: "He ran. He ran. He just ran away. He ran. He ran. He got up and ran. I can't take this anymore... no one can take this... Someone... help me... help me get away... from this wretched place."

Somewhere else in the forest, an unintelligible figure cuts off a body's hands lying on the ground. 
___
Day. Community center of Vyshkanov. A small crowd gathers. There is a long table, with "Alien Research Society of Eurasia" banner hung above. The representatives are at a table covered with odd gadgets, strange alien memorabilia, and a UFO-shaped coffee mug. They each have an armband. 

**ARSE** (offscreen): "Interesting. Most interesting."

**ARSE A**, a middle aged, calm man: "So... Elena, you woke up in the forest. And then?"

**Elena**: "...my father, he was next to me... then... It was dark, but... I thought I saw a shadow. Maybe another person."

**ARSE B**, a younger, overly enthusiastic, childish man, holding up alien figurines: "Damn! Did it look like this? Or this?" 

**Viktor**, a young man next to Elena: "This isn't a joke. Her father is still missing."

**ARSE C**, a woman similar age to B, with a death glare: "Hey, wait your turn. Brat."

**ARSE A**: "Uhhh anyway, what happened next, Elena?"

**Elena**: "My father ran off. I tried to run after him, but... before I knew it, I was back outside the forest." 

**ARSE B**: "Miss Elena, don't worry! I'm sure we'll find a perfectly alien explanation and find your father."

**ARSE C**: "Next!"

Cut to a middle aged woman dressed in traditional Russian attire, sitting at the chair where Elena used to be. She is smiling.

**Anya**: "I don't remember being abducted... Only that I woke up in that dark forest."

**ARSE A**: "Anya, you seem happy about something. Can you tell us why?"

**Anya**: "Why? I saw something beautiful in that forest."

**ARSE B**: "What was it? What did you see??"
**ARSE C**: "Lights? UFO? Come on, spit it out."

**Anya**: "... I'll tell you when I remember what it was."

**ARSE A**: "Miss Anya, please don't waste our time."
**ARSE C**: "NEXT!"

Cut to a young man sitting at the chair. It's Viktor. his expression is stern. 

**ARSE**: "Oh, you're that rude man from before. What's your name?"

**Viktor**: "Viktor."

**ARSE**: "Viktor, did you also wake up in the forest that night?"

**Viktor**: "I did."

**ARSE**: "So what do you-"
**Viktor**: "I think that if you're gonna clown around instead of helping, you should get the hell outta this town."

**ARSE**: "What the... Hey, where're you going?"

Cut to a fat middle aged man wearing a tin foil sitting at the chair.

**David**: "Now, for the real show! I've done my own investigation. I've got theories!"

**ARSE C**: "Yes David, we know you have theories. But do you have proof? Or are you just gonna make shit up?"

**David**: "Just hear me out! I wouldn't have called you guys here if there was nothing. Do you know the history of Vyshkanov? This used to be a space town. Home to the abandoned Eurasian Space Program. You know what that means? Government secrets!"

**ARSE A**: "David, let's take a step back. Do you remember your abduction?"

**David**: "I'll get there, just let me finish! Take a look at this. I took this photo a few days ago. What do you think these are?"

**ARSE B**: "UFOs?!"

**David**: "Exactly! You see, the government says they abandoned the space program, but that's just a lie... They hide aliens in that forest... abduct us and perform unspeakable experiments... and when they're ready, they'll take over the world, because they're run by the Illuminati! That's right! They could be anywhere! In fact, if you ask me... The most suspicious person... Is that man over there!"

David points to Lucas in the crowd. Lucas looks side to side at others, before pointing at himself to confirm if he is who David is talking about.

**David**: "Yes, you! I've never seen you around here. Everybody see for yourselves! Those glasses, this strange coat, this suitcase! And that typical East-Eurasian hair reeking of conformity. This is a secret agent if I've ever seen one!"

By this point, David has gotten within inches from Lucas' face. 

**Lucas**: "Well, if I wanted to keep my identity secret, I probably wouldn't choose such a suggestive attire, given geniuses like you exist. Though it does keep the wind out."

**ARSE B**: "Suspicious visitor, identify yourself!" 

**Lucas**: (taking out his watch) "Lucas Yang. Department of Abnormal Phenomena."

**crowd**: "Gasp" "..." "..." "He's from the government..."
**Elena**, grabbing Lucas' hand: "Does that mean you can help find my father?"
**ARSE B**: "Woah, that badge... that's like, official!"
**ARSE C**: "Tch. Government spook. What does he want in this town?"
**David**: "Aha! Of course the government's involved. First they cover the truth, then they send their suits to 'investigate'. I know your kind, Yang!"

**Lucas**: "I was called here... By your local jeweler."

**ARSE A**: "Anya?"

**Lucas**: (looking at ARSE) "Yes, but looks like someone else arrived first."

**ARSE B**: "That's right! We the Alien Research Society of Eurasia, never fails to respond to alien troubles. That's why we are widely known and respected."

**Lucas**: "Of course. I'm sure you leave behind an impression wherever you go."

The crowd laughs. 

**Lucas**: "You know, for an organisation in search for aliens, you lot are surprisingly predictable. That's because you arrived with an answer already in mind. It makes you miss things. Important details."
**ARSE C**: "Just who the hell do you think-"
**ARSE B**, to A: "Hey, it's ok."
**ARSE A**: "Such as?"

**Lucas**: "Everyone that was abducted to the forest... has red circular burn marks in their hands!"

**person near Elena**: "Oh shit, how did that get there? Did you burn yourself?"
**Elena**: "I don't know..."

**Lucas**: "Except you, David."
