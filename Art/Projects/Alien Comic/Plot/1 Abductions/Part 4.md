part 5 plan as well:


___
Elena and Viktor sit at the edge of the forest, looking in. It is early evening. 

Elena: "It's all over. Father's gone. We'll be next. The town isn't safe anymore." 
Viktor: "What if we left? What if we go to... Rome? Or Shanghai? Eurasia is so big. We can vanish into the noise."
Elena: "What's the point?"
Viktor: "Elena... what are you saying? Remember when we were still small, you always wanted to..." 
Elena: "Don't you get it? It was over the second we stepped into that forest. Their eyes are everywhere. Nowhere is safe! We didn't leave the forest that night. Not really. We will never be..."
Viktor: "That's not true. We're still here, still ourselves." 
Elena, eyes watery: "Do you really believe that?"
Viktor: "I have to. If i don't... I'm afraid I'll forget who I am. Who you are." 
They embrace. Elena's ring gleams in the sunlight. 

**Lucas:** _(with a half-smile)_ _"Don’t worry. I’m exceptionally good at pretending things didn’t happen."_

**Lucas steps closer, his tone shifting—gently probing.**  
**Lucas:** _"I just had a few questions. About your father. What kind of man was he? What kind of people did he... get involved with?"_

**Narration (as Elena hesitates):**  
_Her father was a silent man. Drank often. Hard to love. Harder to care for. Harsh with Viktor, with Anya, with Kolya. After David moved to town, he got obsessed with conspiracies. Started muttering about the Illuminati._

**Lucas:** _"Is this ‘Illuminati’ the _they_ you’re afraid of?"_  
**Narration:**  
_Elena isn’t sure. All she knows is what her father said—that they’re powerful elites controlling governments, orchestrating something catastrophic. Maybe madness. Maybe truth. Maybe both._

**A long pause. The forest hums. A wind stirs.**  
**Lucas straightens, brushing off his coat.**  
**Lucas:** _"Thank you. That’s... helpful."_  
**Elena:** _"Where are you going?"_  
**Lucas:** _(tilting his head toward the trees)_ _"Into the forest. Some things can’t be understood from the outside."_  
**Viktor:** _"Are you sure that’s a good idea?"_  
**Lucas:** _(with a faint, unreadable smile)_ _"Rarely. But necessary all the same."_

**He steps past them and disappears into the trees. The forest swallows him.**




Lucas carefully steps through the undergrowth. He sees Anya ahead. 
They walk together: "You know, I used to think the forest was just trees and dirt. But that's wrong. It's a time capsule." 

Narration: Anya seemed to speak a little differently from before. Lucas couldn't decide whether it was his imagination. 

Anya: "This amount of gemstone would be so valuable. The government can make a lot of money with it." 
Lucas: "...You want to sell us this blue quartz."
Anya: "Who wouldn't want this? A good gemstone is like a star. Ancient and indifferent. Under the right light... it burns. And tells you something about the world it came from." 
Anya: "I don't know what it's telling us, but I see its beauty. A blue out of this world."
Lucas: "This..."
Anya, face lighting up: "O-oh... Is that so?" 







"I'm not part of the Illuminati, even though the Illuminati was real. Yes, they were real. I've seen the documents. The Eurasian Federation captured and executed all of them during the Great Purge. I'm not here to cover up anything or hurt anyone. I work as a small mundane cog in the bureaucratic machine of Eurasia. My work usually consists of taking photos and writing reports, and a lot of transit, and dealing with sad people. I'm not here to make any enemies or friends. I care about nothing but the truth. And I believe I figured it out."
