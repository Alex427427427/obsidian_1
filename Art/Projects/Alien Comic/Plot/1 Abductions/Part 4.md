part 5 plan as well:


___
Elena and Viktor sit at the edge of the forest, looking in. It is early evening. 

Elena: "It's all over. Father's gone. We'll be next. The town isn't safe anymore." 
Viktor: "What if we left? What if we go to... Rome? Or Shanghai? Eurasia is so big. We can vanish into the noise."
Elena: "What's the point?"
Viktor: "Elena... what are you saying? Remember when we were still small, you always wanted to..." 
Elena: "Don't you get it? It was over the second we stepped into that forest. Their eyes are everywhere. Nowhere is safe! We didn't leave the forest that night. Not really. We will never be..."
Viktor: "That's not true. We're still here, still ourselves." 
Elena, eyes watery: "Do you really believe that?"
Viktor: "I have to. If i don't... I'm afraid I'll forget who I am. Who you are." 
They embrace. Elena's ring gleams in the sunlight. 

Lucas: "Didn't mean to intrude."
They are startled. 
Lucas: "I get it. You two are holding onto each other like the wind's about to tear the world apart. I know that feeling, though I haven't felt it in a long time. You think that if you stay very still, maybe nothing can find you." 
Lucas: "But before I go, humour me... What kind of man was your father? What kind of people was he involved with?" 
Narration: Elena's father was a silent man. Drank often. Unkind to everyone - Viktor, uncle Kolya... He was hard to love and take care of. Got into conspiracy theories after David came to town. Started mumbling about the Illuminati. 
Lucas: "The Illuminati huh? What do you know about them?"
Narration: A secret society of rich and powerful elites that control the world's governments. Some say they are reptiles. Some say they have contact with aliens. 
Lucas: "Good to know. You should stay in the community center with everyone else."
Lucas checking the watch: "And if you remember more... tell me before I'm too far in to hear it." 

Lucas carefully steps through the undergrowth. He sees Anya ahead. 
They walk together: "You know, I used to think the forest was just trees and dirt. But that's wrong. It's a time capsule." 

Narration: Anya seemed to speak a little differently from before. Lucas couldn't decide whether it was his imagination. 

Anya: "This amount of gemstone would be so valuable. The government can make a lot of money with it." 
Lucas: "...You want to sell us this blue quartz."
Anya: "Who wouldn't want this? A good gemstone is like a star. Ancient and indifferent. Under the right light... it burns. And tells you something about the world it came from." 
Anya: "I don't know what it's telling us, but I see its beauty. A blue out of this world."
Lucas: "This..."
Anya, face lighting up: "O-oh... Is that so?" 







"I'm not part of the Illuminati, even though the Illuminati was real. Yes, they were real. I've seen the documents. The Eurasian Federation captured and executed all of them during the Great Purge. I'm not here to cover up anything or hurt anyone. I work as a small mundane cog in the bureaucratic machine of Eurasia. My work usually consists of taking photos and writing reports, and a lot of transit, and dealing with sad people. I'm not here to make any enemies or friends. I care about nothing but the truth. And I believe I figured it out."
