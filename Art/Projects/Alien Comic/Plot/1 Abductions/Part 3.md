part 4 

Lucas goes to visit Viktor and confronts him about lying of being abducted, and that Elena and Viktor are secretly lovers. Viktor admits but 

Lucas meets up with ARSE at comm center. 

After work, Lucas meets with Anya who takes him to the forest. She shows him the history of the eurasian space program. Then the quartz cave. 

When Lucas and Anya returns, there is commotion in the town. 


**Anya**: (happy to see him but also sad) “Ahhh, Mr. Yang. I’m sorry things turned out this way.”

**Lucas**: “No, the apology is mine.”

**Anya**: (shrugs) “Guess I shouldn’t have played along with the whole abduction thing. I was just trying to stir things up, get people talking, you know? But all it did was attract a bunch of nutjobs… and you.”

**Lucas**: “Well, I’m here now.”

**Anya**: (with a light smile) “While you’re here, why don’t you take a look at these new rings I made?” (She gestures to a tray of beautifully crafted quartz rings) “Got a girl on your mind? These would make a great gift. North Eurasian blue quartz—coated so they don’t chip as easily.”

**Lucas**: (glancing at the rings, not engaging) “Thanks, but I’m not interested in quartz. Do you make aluminum rings?”

**Anya**: (feigning disappointment) “Aluminum? Really? Surely someone working for the government can afford a *proper* ring.”

**Lucas**: (with a subtle smirk) “I’m just curious. Has anyone purchased an Aluminium ring from you recently?”

**Anya**: (sighs and reaches for her record book) “Let me check...” (She flips through the pages, her tone becoming more serious as she scans the names) “Viktor...”

**Lucas**: (leaning in) “Viktor? When was that?”

**Anya**: (glancing up, a teasing glint returning to her eyes) “Oh, just a few days ago...”

**Lucas**: (ignoring her bait, focused) “Can I take a copy of that page?”

**Anya**: (smirking) “Sure. And if you ever change your mind about those rings... I could help you find something a little more personal.”

**Lucas**: (straightening up) “I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks.”

Anya takes Lucas into the forest, where she was abducted, and found quartz.
