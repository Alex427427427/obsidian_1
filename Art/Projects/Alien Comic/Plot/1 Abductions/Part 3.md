ARSE members walk through the worn Vyshkanov. 

ARSE B: "Man, what did we get ourselves into?"

ARSE A: "It's what we wanted, wasn't it?"

ARSE B: "Hey, *I* didn't wanna see a *dead* person. Besides, why do *we* have to do the questioning?"

ARSE C: "Lucas is a tyrant. He thinks just because he has a badge he gets to treat us like errand kids."

ARSE A: "We did ask how we could help."

They arrive at the apartment. 

ARSE B: "Alright... Who wants to knock?"

---

Uncle Kolya opens the door. 

ARSE A: "Hello, Kolya."

Kolya: "Ah. You. You come to forest with drone again, I throw shovel. You hear me?"

ARSE C: "We're here about the body. And the forest."

ARSE B: "And aliens! Don't forget aliens!"

Kolya: "Bah. What happened to country? You see doodle on tree, you think space man. You need hobby. Try gardening."

ARSE A: "It's not just the carvings on the trees, Kolya. Elena's father is dead." 

Kolya: "Dead!?"

ARSE A: "Yes. And we want to know where you were that night."

Anya uses the grinder in her workshop. Lucas comes to the display window. 

Anya: "Ahh, Mr Yang. I'm sorry things turned out this way."

Lucas: "No, the apology is mine."

Anya: "I keep thinking about Elena... Sweet girl. Watched her grow up right here in this town. And now... this mess. She really shoulda left years ago."

Lucas: "Why didn't she?"

Anya: "She tried. Had offers for school. Big ones! Then she broke her leg. Twice, actually. Mother's not around. Her father got sick. She stayed to care for him. Life kept getting in the way. It's like there's something evil in this town that doesn't want her to leave."

Lucas: "Something evil? Do you... believe in aliens, Anya?"

Anya: "Well, I'm no woman of science. Space... Aliens... What do I know? Do you?"

Lucas doesn't say a word. 

Anya: "...Mr Yang?"

Lucas: "These are some beautiful rings."

Anya: "I'm so glad you noticed! North Eurasian blue quartz. Rare stuff."

Lucas: "Is it?"

Anya: "Can't find it anywhere else. Just finished this set two days ago!"

Lucas: "Your hands create wonders."

Anya: "Oh! You say the sweetest things. I should hire you to stand around and flatter me while I work."

Lucas: "Tempting. But the people of Eurasia need me to do their paper pushing."

Anya: "I figured. Got a girl on your mind? These rings would surely impress."

Lucas: "Sorry, I'm not interested in quartz. I was actually wondering... Do you ever make Aluminium rings?" 

Anya: "Hah? You mean just Aluminium? Surely a man working for the government can afford a *proper* ring."

Lucas: "Just curious. Has anyone bought one recently?"

Anya: "Umm, I can give you the ledger. I doubt you'll find anything. I let Viktor borrow my workshop a while ago. Maybe he would know? Would you like me to make you one?"

Lucas: "No, that's fine."

Kolya grabs ARSE A's collar: "What do you mean he dead? How he die?"

ARSE B: "Whoa whoa, calm down!"

ARSE C: "Quit pretending. We know someone who saw you in the forest on the night everyone got abducted." 

ARSE A: "The man’s head was crushed. Hands were cut off."

**KOLYA (blinks):**  
Crushed? Who... Nothing but racoon go there!

**ARSE C:**  
What were you doing out there?

**KOLYA:**  
I wasn’t! I stay home. Every night. I always tired. Five o’clock I am back. Six, I eat. Seven, I sleep. Like soldier. 

**ARSE A:**  
Tired from what?

**KOLYA (snaps):**  
From working! No, no, this is madness.

**ARSE C (deadpan):**  
We’re just saying—it’s weird. You own half the tools needed to take a man apart.

**ARSE A:**  
And they never found a murder weapon.

**ARSE B:**  
Mind if we take a look at them?

**KOLYA:**  
No one touches my tools! I don't care who you work for. 

Kolya is ready to slam the door. ARSE A stops him.
ARSE A, taking out a picture: "Wait, Kolya, just one more thing. Can you identify the plant in this picture?"

Kolya: "Eh? That's wild parsnip. I done with your questionaires. Now get lost!"


_He slams the door._
_A beat. The ARSE trio stares at the closed door._

**ARSE A (quiet):** "We messed that up, didn’t we?"

**ARSE C:** "Speak for yourself, Emmet. I had him sweating."

**ARSE B (half-panicked):** "We shouldn’t even be doing this. We’re not real investigators. Seriously, why did Mr. Yang send _us_?"

Lucas looks at the ledger. 

Anya: "Aluminium... cheap as dirt, easy to scratch, you may as well wrap your finger in tin foil. Who would want such a thing?"

Lucas: "Someone that couldn't afford more, maybe."

Suddenly, Lucas tightens. 

Lucas: "Anya... where do you get your gems?"

Anya: "Imports, mostly. At least since the mines shut down. Sometimes I let Viktor run errands. Why?"

Lucas: "This sudden influx of blue quartz... It doesn't make sense. You said only Vyshkanov has it. But none of the mines here are operational." 

Anya puts her hand on the ledger, lowers her voice, almost conspiratorial. 

Anya: "I didn't really wake up in the forest, Mr Yang."

Lucas: "..."

Anya, glancing at the back window: "That's not really why I asked you to come here. I want to show you something. It's deep in the woods. It's beautiful. I don't want anyone else to find it."

Lucas, carefully: "What are you talking about?"

Anya: "Meet me at the forest's edge after dark. Bring a torch."
___

(Community center, David explain to police that the symbols are from illuminati. 
Lucas orders drone surveillance footage from Department of Information and Statistics. 
ARSE members arrive and tell him about Kolya. 
ARSE members decide among themselves to stake out Kolya.)


Community center, some people have set up blankets. Listening to David and the police. 

David: "You've all seen it by now. But you probably didn't know what you were looking at. This is the 'All-Seeing Eye'. The eye of surveillance. The symbol of the Illuminati!"

Lucas walks in and sees the speech by David. 
David: "The pyramid has three edges. Three corners. That represents the three pillars of the Illuminati - the government, the rich, and aliens."

ARSE come up to greet him. 
Narration: "Emmet, Tim and Carin of ARSE rushed to tell Lucas what happened at the Kolya interview. Lucas wasn't entirely interested."

Lucas: "Hm."

Carin: (ARSE C) "Really, what does that mean? Just a 'Hm'?"
Tim (ARSE B): "We coulda been shovelled to death! He coulda been a, a, Illuminati agent or something."

Lucas: "Noted. Let me know when he takes a swing."

Emmet (ARSE A) catches up to Lucas, handing him the photo: "It's parsnip."

Lucas: "So it is."




Lucas Yang waits at the edge of the center. He flips his wrist badge open - it's a transceiver. 
XCVR: "Eurasian Bureau of Anomalies, northern sub-channel - identify and state request." 

Lucas: "Field inspector Lucas Yang. Identification LYAN01-Beijing, requesting drone surveillance data, Vyshkanov forest, at uh eastern and southern egress points. June 28th 1700 to 29th 800." 

XCVR: "So, you're asking for footage that's 3 days old. That would've been pushed to the Department of Information and Statistics already. One moment while I forward your request. Anything else I should include?" 

Lucas: "Get a profile of every individual that entered and exited the forest for the entire month. Push to my node."

XCVR: "...Confirmed. Packet ETA 20 minutes."




The ARSE trio.
ARSE B: "He blew us off."
ARSE C: "Maybe _he_ is hiding something. Sends us in circles, keeps us busy while he does... who knows what."
ARSE A: "Why would he do that?"
ARSE C: "Distract. Misdirect. You never know who to trust and what is real. I say We must take matters into our own hands." 
ARSE C: "Tonight, we camp near Kolya's building. If he heads to the forest, we follow. If we catch him doing anything weird..."



{He blew us off. 

Not all of us. }
