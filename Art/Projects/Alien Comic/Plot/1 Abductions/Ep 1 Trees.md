## Solution
Two young lovers, Viktor and Elena meet in secret in the forest near the neighbourhood. That night, Viktor gives Elena a ring he bought from the local jeweler. Elena's abusive father forbids their relationship. He finds them in the forest and attacks Viktor. Elena kills her father in a moment of panic, by striking him in the back of his head with a heavy rock obtained from a nearby quartz outgrowth. 
Just as they carry the corpse to somewhere they can bury, they see an old man nearby, not moving. They are scared. The old man was in fact sleep walking. They abandon the corpse into the middle of a wych elm. 
Hanging out at the local community center, the local conspiracy theorist speaks of seeing UFOs near the forest. Viktor and Elena use this opportunity to spread the rumour that they've been abducted by aliens to the forest, and waking up with strange marks.

## Part 1 - The Crime
A strange looking tree. An old man stands still. A young man runs through the forest, panicking. A young woman runs through the forest, in the opposite direction. A man's body is in the middle. 
## Part 2 - The Investigator
At the local community center, a group of alien conspiracy theorists are interviewing a few locals, who claim they have been abducted by aliens into the forest. The order is: a young woman, Elena, daughter of the deceased, whose father is still missing; an old woman, jeweler; a young man, Viktor; another young man, local conspiracy theorist. 
By the time the local conspiracy theorist is done telling about the UFOs above the forest, he points to a man wearing glasses and a trench coat sitting by the side, thinking he looks the most suspicious. The man wearing glasses introduces himself as Lucas. 
Lucas reveals that he has been investigating the so called UFOs spotted over the district, and they are just land surveying drones from the Factory Array; in fact, he carries one himself in his suitcase. He questions how the conspiracy theorist can call himself an investigator, when he can't even do the most basic research on what simpler explanations exist. The theorists question Lucas' credentials. Lucas explains that he is from the Department of Abnormal Phenomena, here to investigate the mess the theorist is spreading. And it's not looking good for the theorist. The theorists scared off Elena, and Lucas is annoyed he will have to go talk to them himself. 
## Part 3 - Initial Investigations
Lucas visits Elena, Viktor, jeweler, and various other people in the district, to interview them. Lucas shakes hands with each of them, to learn about them. Elena has a ring. Viktor has clammy skin, meaning he is nervous. 
Lucas then goes to the forest in hopes to find any suspicious signs. There, he meets the old man who tends to a tree in the forest, who is angry at him intruding. 
## Body Found
Lucas uses the drone and finds the body in the woods. He notices some shiny quartz crystals in the back of the body's head. He calls the State Security Service. While he waits for them to arrive, he runs around the crime scene, kneeling down to touch the ground, until he identifies dried blood on the ground somewhere a bit further, near a quartz crystal growth. 
## Part 4 - Second Investigations
The body was identified as Elena's father, time of death being the same night that everyone claims to be abducted. Cause of death was a trauma to the back of the head. 
The SSS captures everyone that was there on the night of the murder. Lucas listens in on the interviews. Elena's father was abusive. Viktor seems to have nothing to do with any of this. Jeweler {}. Conspiracy theorist argued with Elena's father a lot. The old man refuses to be interviewed, because he thinks everything is a joke. 
At this point, Lucas suspects the old man the most, who is the only person that regularly visits the district. At night, he waits in the streets, and sees the old man exit his house and walk towards the forest. Lucas follows. 
## Pivotal Realisation
Lucas looks at his hand, and sees red circular marks show up. 
## Part 5 - Enlightenment
Lucas informs everyone to go to the forest and catch the alien. The SSS helps him bring everyone there.
