## Situation Before Climax
Eurasian gov knows about the conspiracy and has imprisoned Patricia. 

Patricia's conspiracy continues to work on the speaker network. 

Lucas is under the care of the government. 

The Academy desperately tries to study the song. Lambda broadcasts the secret to the world. 
## Climax
Lucas decides the only way to evade disaster is to go into space, so he must find out the coordinates of Satellite 6 while the rest of the government constructs the rockets. 

Patricia's forces stop him from doing so by destroying the rockets that were their last hope. However, Lucas does manage to deliver to the Factory Array the coordinates of Satellite 6. 

Make sure to foreshadow Constitution of the Earth Federation during meetings with Illuminati.
