## Situation Before Climax
Eurasian gov knows about the conspiracy and has imprisoned Patricia. 

Patricia's conspiracy continues to work on the speaker network. 

Lucas is under the care of the government. 

The Academy desperately tries to study the song. 
## Climax
Lucas decides the only way to evade disaster is to go into space, so he must find out the coordinates of Satellite 6 while the rest of the government constructs the rockets. 

Patricia's forces stop him from doing so by destroying the rockets that were their last hope. However, Lucas does manage to deliver to the Factory Array the coordinates of Satellite 6. 

Make sure to foreshadow Constitution of the Earth Federation during meetings with Illuminati.

## Order of Events
1. Lucas finds Marco dead at the Factory Array, with a message to him inciting mystery to be solved. 
2. Lucas investigates various episodic mysteries related to alien conspiracies, like abductions and sightings, always finding the truth to be non-alien related. 
3. Susan investigates a strange disease spreading through Eurasia. Lucas helps her gather information. 
4. Lucas' investigations lead him to the Illuminati, who have been observing him and recruit him. He befriends Patricia. 
5. Susan deduces the true method of transmission of the disease (still kept hidden from readers until later), but she herself contracts it. 
6. Pivotal case: Lucas investigates reports of a star disappearing and reappearing at fixed times every night. Lucas deduces that this is caused by the daily transit of Satellite 6. 
7. The discovery makes big news. Lucas and Susan celebrate but Susan cries because her life is falling apart. Susan finds out Lucas has been investigating Marco's death and is mad, but they make up. They decide to escape Eurasia together. 
8. Lucas and Susan get caught by the Eurasian secret police, and are sent to the Eurasian Nucleus for interrogation. Susan reveals that the disease is spread by a song, which, when heard in full, is able to fully remove the consciousness of a person from their body. Patricia 'saves' them by taking Susan and Lucas away, but immediately kills Susan with the song, revealing her full plans to Lucas. 
9. The Eurasian Nucleus seizes Patricia, while Lucas is in despair, and the world is about to end when the speaker network is fully repaired. The Eurasian army tries to destroy the speaker network but is in a standoff against the Oceanian and American armies who want to protect it. 
10. Lucas realizes the truths about the universe. But he pretends to come up with another plan - they must escape to Satellite 6. Lucas asks the Eurasian Nucleus to revive the space program. Patricia's conspiracy destroys the space program again, seemingly winning. 
11. The song is played, and the whole world is turned into the frequency domain. 
12. In the frequency domain, Patricia reveals her identity to Lucas. But after the initial emotional exchanges, Lucas also reveals his true plan - the space program was a distraction, while Lucas was able to deliver the coordinates of Satellite 6 to the Factory Array. 
13. All paths of the continental train network converge at the Factory Array, who uses the elevated train tracks to send a drone to space, retrieve the Constitution, broadcast it to the universe, receive the reversal song, and return everyone back into the real world. 
14. Back when Susan first died, her body was preserved by Lucas in a cryo chamber. Thus her consciousness was able to return. Susan and Lucas walk into the city lights.
