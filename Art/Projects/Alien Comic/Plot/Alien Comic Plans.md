## Hook
Depict conspiracy theories and theorists. Illuminati. Aliens. 
## Themes 
[[Information]] and [[Humanity's Triumph]]. See those documents. 
## Big Idea
Crazy conspiracy theories sweep over a continent and a government task force (within which is the protagonist) is deployed to dispell them. A hidden true conspiracy from within the government is revealed, and the protagonists urgently try to stop it. Central mysteries along the way hold the answers to how it can be stopped. By the end, a full dialogue (in whatever form) between the two sides of the information debate outlined in [[Information]] should have played out, preferably near the climax. 

Additionally, I want the major mystery thread to be about Marco's cryptic messages, Dark Matter, and the fact that alien civilisations exist in abundance in the dark sectors of the universe. A fact that Lucas realises near the end to save the day. 
##### Alien Thread
The alien thread has a few unresolved ideas. 
1. **How** does Marco come to **realise** there are **aliens**? In my set up, they are the apparent **dark matter** that we cannot see. But how does Marco realise they are aliens? *The Factory Array studied the boltzmann noise and found out, and told Marco.*
2. **Why** must Marco keep this a **secret**? *He felt in danger, pursued by the Eurasian secret police.*
3. How would **Lucas** know about the **aliens**? *From contextual clues - Marco's clues - dark matter, boltzmann noise. This is unnecessary from the Factory Array's point of view. Lucas merely needed to show the Factory Array where Satellite 2 is, so the Factory Array could contact the rest of the universe.*
4. The **communication must be instant** for Lucas to contact the aliens at the end and have it have any effect on the story. **How would the communication work**? *On space station Satellite 2, exists the first technology to communicate instantaneously using wavefunction collapse, intended to serve was the newest generation of the internet. But as soon as it was turned on, the engineers heard boltzmann noise despite not having sent any information themselves. Boltzmann noise is the hypothetically most efficient way to stuff information into the frequency domain. This was the communication happening throughout the universe, between alien civilisations.*
5. How would **Lucas** know about the method of instantaneous **communication**? *From passing conversations with Marco.*
6. How does **contacting** the **aliens save the day**? *This goes back to the nature of the crisis. Satellite 2 sent a cry for help to the aliens due to global conflict. They replied with a song that would neutralise all conscious life that were not deaf - like a spell. Now, the earth needs to reply back something it was never able to centuries ago - that the war is over. An reverse song will be sent. When the Factory Array first told this to Marco, he laughed.*
7. Why must the **Factory Array** be **cryptic** with its plan? *There is a conspiracy in the government to play the song to everyone.*
