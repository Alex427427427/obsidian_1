___
## Dark Sector
Sounds scientific. Slightly mysterious. Hints at the dark matter relevant to the story. 
## Beneath the City Lights
Has some poetic vibe, and matches the main motif throughout the story. But too general to a reader, it could be about anything. 
## In City Darkness
Similar to "Beneath the City Lights", but a bit more brief
## There are no Aliens in Eurasia (CHOSEN)
Bit wordy, but very unambiguous in semantics. Gives some sense of what the story will revolve around, and implies some quirkiness regarding how information is controlled in Eurasia. The story is clearly about aliens, but the title says there are none, as if the title is trying to gaslight the reader. 
## A Universe that Blinks

## The Eurasian Syndrome
