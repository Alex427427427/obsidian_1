Use veil around Susan as example of dark matter. 
## Marco's Messages
##### A poem for Susan
At the Factory Array 
A place of glorious industry
I insert a blueprint
of a very special thing
And I wait
When the sun sets, I collect the fruit of my labour
My conspiracy is complete
I come to you with my gift
**It is a robe made with the blackness of space. 
I wrap the robe around you
You wrap your arms around me. 
Above us, the city lights shine like stars. 
And beneath them, we have become ghosts.** 
##### A message for Lucas
Once, Susan told me a childish idea. 
It captivated me so much, 
I never saw the city the same way.
