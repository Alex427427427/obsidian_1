___
A disease appearing seldomly in Eurasia. 
## Origin
See [[Doomsday Song]]. When Patricia initially brought the song to Professor Lambda, whom she had romantic involvements with, they experimented it on some prisoners. 

The prisoners who heard various amounts of the song, developed various extents of the Flowerhead Syndrome. It also allowed them to disappear and reappear at other locations in space. They escaped. 
## Symptoms
- Deformations of the head, as if the brain was stretched and molded by the song, and the frame followed the brain. 
- Dissociation with spacetime. Disappearing and reappearing elsewhere. Stochastically recalling events from the future or a distant past. 
- Others around will be able to hear certain thoughts from those contracted with the syndrome. 
## The Spreaders
Some prisoners thought this was a god given gift. They move around Eurasia, converting more people to this state, by singing the song that rings in their heads to them. Due to the difficulty in capturing them, Patricia and Lambda were unable to contain the disease. 
## Responses
##### From the Eurasian Nucleus
Deploys various continental labs to study the disease. Intelligence leaks are terrible for the look of the country and security. If the disease is leaked and controlled by another state, they could be in trouble. As a result, any attempts by people with knowledge of the disease to flee Eurasia are prohibited. 

If a person presents with the Flowerhead syndrome, the government issues travel restrictions to their friends and families.
