## Structure
##### The First Director
The person that holds ultimate authority. Infallible and the source of all major decisions. Their word is law, and are surrounded by a cult of personality. Nominated by the Eurasian Nucleus. 
##### The Eurasian Nucleus 
The core governing body, responsible for implementing the leader' directives across the federation. Consists of directors who oversee different aspects of **governance**, such as security, information, economics. Each director wields considerable power within their domain but remains loyal to the First Director. Notable Directors:
1. Statistics and Information - manages the federation archives, collects and interprets statistics, controls the flow of information. 
##### The Ministers
Below the Eurasian Nucleus, the ministers manage specific sectors of the country. Agriculture, education, mining, healthcare, etc. While they have some autonomy, their decisions are closely monitored by the Eurasian Nucleus and must align with the overall agenda of the federation. 
##### Regional Governors
They implement the federation's directives locally. They must report to the Eurasian Nucleus and accept audits by them, along with the ministers. 
##### Auxiliary Departments
Bloatware of the federation bureaucracy. One example being Department of Abnormal Phenomena - really just a place for, say, deadbeat physics graduates that have nowhere else to apply their skills. 
##### The Secret Police
Tasked with identifying, interrogating, and neutralising political threats to the federation. Answers directly to the Eurasian Nucleus and the First Director, such that regular police cannot get in their way. They may use brutal methods regularly prohibited by law. Feared and respected within the government. They have knowledge about everyone in government and can destroy careers. 
Hierarchy:
1. Chief - responsible for overall strategy and operations. 
2. Regional Commanders - oversee operations in different parts of the federation.
3. Field Agents - conduct day to day ops, surveillance, arrests, interrogations. 
4. Informants - civilians who provide intelligence to the secret police. 
General behaviour: 
1. For minor offenders, such as those caught distributing anti-federation pamphlets or participating in unauthorised protests: intimidation, short term detention, forced confessions. Re-education via mandatory lessons and perhaps coerced to becoming informants. 
2. For serious offenders, such as those caught of treason, espionage: torture and interrogation to extract information about accomplices; made example through public trial, or disappearance. 
## Evaluation
This structure of governance results in highly effective control and elimination of internal threats. However, there is instability due to constant paranoia of betrayal from within. 
## Attitude towards foreign states
In cautious competition. Worried that
