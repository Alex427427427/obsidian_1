## Description
A song that "kills" anyone who listens to it, by converting their consciousness into the frequency domain. Unbeknownst to characters in the story, the song came from space, and is of alien origin. 
## History
When the engineers on Satellite 6 first cried for help into the Einstein-Rosen Transceiver during the previous world war, the universe sent back this song. All consciousness of the world that could hear, upon hearing this song, were lost to the frequency domain. Their bodies decomposed shortly after, removing any possibility of them returning to regular spacetime. 

It was the first half of an unfulfilled promise, where humans were to send a declaration of peace, and an inverse song would be sent back, converting the lost consciousness back into the real domain. The engineers did not fully understand the preceding messages from the aliens, and were unable to protect themselves and carry through the promise. 

This singular secret piece of history was lost on Director Patricia, who thought the engineers themselves created this song, as if casting a spell down at the war-torn humanity. 

Now recordings of the song and various early communications on Satellite 6 live in the deepest archives of the Bureau of Information and Statistics, under Director Patricia's control. She original searched for this song after her realisation that whatever ended the last world war must had been an auditory weapon. 
## Side Effects
When not heard completely, leaves the person in an intermediate state between the real world and the frequency domain. Develops into the Flowerhead Syndrome.
