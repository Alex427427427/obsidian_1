## Concern
Conspiracies begin with a genuine concern. For Patricia, it is resource depletion. Centuries of over-consumption and mismanagement have destroyed the natural reservoirs of rare earth elements. The electronics that Eurasian life depends on will one day cease to function. What awaits is the largest scale human suffering in history. But she claims that the government doesn't care, and cannot be made to change their ways; a revolution is not possible either (she saw her friends in the Enlightenment Society hunted down and either killed or intimidated). 
##### The Hidden Motive
Patricia sees the frequency domain as a sort of heaven where reality is her making; she wants to reunite with her students again - her memories of them will be as good as real in the frequency domain. 
## Goal
Remove a vast portion of the population, in a humane way. 
## The Plan
Patricia discovered the doomsday song ([[Doomsday Song]]). The plan is to play the song over a vast network of speakers scattered across the continent, so that all those who can hear will have their consciousness transported to the frequency domain. 
## Recruitment
Patricia has a group of recruiters that find doomers, introduce them to the doomsday song, give them a copy, and instructs them to follow through with the plan. 
##### Professor Lambda
Leads a neuroscience lab. Patricia initially approached him, promising him a good life and limitless funding. He accepted. Over time, he became partial to her cause. The two would fall in love. 
##### Lucas 
Unbeknownst to Lucas, he has been serving Patricia's plan by listening to her. 
## Keys to Success
##### people to hold onto the doomsday song
She needs a large group of people committed to her goal, ready to seize the broadcast towers to play the song when the time is right. 
##### broadcast towers to be repaired
The continent is littered with derelict communication towers. These need to be repaired for the song to reach all Eurasians' ears. 
##### deafness eradicated
To make all people go into the frequency domain, she needs deafness to be eradicated, so a new civilisation cannot be built again - more civilisation just means repetition of the same mistakes, and more suffering in the future. 
##### no solution to reverse the effects of the doomsday song
As stated. 
##### herself having a reason to continue the conspiracy
If she finds reasons to have hope for humanity, then she would abandon the conspiracy. To prevent this from happening, she kills those that give her reasons not to go through with the conspiracy. From her point of view, this is the biggest threat to her conspiracy. She needs to see her students.
