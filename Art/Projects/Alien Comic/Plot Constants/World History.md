## Towards Earth Federation
The world was moving towards unification. Alongside humanity's entrance into space, and the establishment of 8 settlements in geosynchronous orbit, there was a growing consciousness... that people were not just members of a tribe, or a nation, but humanity as a whole. 

World leaders were starting to draft a Constitution of the Earth Federation. But conservative factions opposed this globalist agenda. They seeded division and mistrust of the government into the population. The world became more divided, and a war broke out, between nations that seeked to preserve their cultural identity. 
## First Contact and End of the War
Around this time, a new communication channel was opened up - that allowed instant communication by listening to quantum state collapses. The engineers on Satellite 6 discovered the channel to be non-empty, and already fully efficiently populated by messages travelling between unknown reaches of space. They were listening to a lively conversation between alien civilisations. 

They requested help to the aliens. The aliens, cold and mysterious, sent back an audio weapon - a song that would incapacitate humans that could listen - this should take care of most people involved with conflict. Once humans send back a declaration that humanity was capable of peace, the aliens can reply with a song that reversed the effects of the first. 

The proof would have been the Constitution of the Earth Federation, if there was anyone left to do it. 
## New Modern Age
The deaf humans survived - and over time, rebuilt civilisation in Eurasia, Oceania, and the rest of the world. Eurasia was the first to advance, with the help of the continental Factory Array. 

The governments of the world, distrustful of one another, destroyed copies of the Constitution of the Earth Federation. Leaving the ones on the Satellites to be the only remaining copies.
