___
Engineer at the Factory Array that loves to stargaze. Lucas' friend, Susan's husband, Patricia's ally, member of the Illuminati. 
## History
##### Grandfather's Secret
His grandfather, first and last Eurasian cosmonaut, once went to space via the now defunct space program. In space, he saw a black spec that was close to earth - it is in fact one of the geosynchronous space stations Satellite 6. Thus he told Marco of the secret treasure of immeasurable value. 
##### Recruitment into the Illuminati
He was first recruited into the Illuminati due to his ideals. Then he befriends Patricia, who by this time is already setting the conspiracy in motion. 
##### Learning the Truth about the World
Then the Factory Array tells him about the history of the world. He begins constructing a large object, thought to be a weapon but actually a method of communication. 
##### Spilling the Truth to Patricia and Death
Marco, excited, tells Patricia:
- the existence of aliens
- the need to contact them
Marco withholds:
- the location of Satellite 6
- the importance of the Constitution of the Earth Federation
Patricia, thinking that contact with aliens would spell death for her plan, kills him with the song. This is the only thing she is afraid of. 
##### Puzzles Left Behind
Marco, once suspecting he will die, lays out a plan for others to carry out. Marco had the key to defeating the conspiracy. He split the key in half, one hidden in plain sight that only Lucas could understand (the only copy of the Constitution of the Earth Federation that hasn't been destroyed is on Satellite 6), the other hidden in plain sight that only Susan could understand (aliens are what we perceive as dark matter in the universe). He hopes that Lucas and Susan will come together to do what he couldn't - deliver the Earth Federation Constitution to the aliens as a proof of humanity being a peaceful species. (He keeps this amount of secrecy because he realised that Patricia and possibly the rest of the Illuminati is not what it seems. He cannot trust anyone but those closest to him. He also knows there will be a great disaster coming.)

Therefore, the things he leaves behind are:
- A message that only Lucas would understand, that Marco hid **a great treasure sought after by many.** The treasure is in a black metal box - later referred to as "Marco's box" - that he left in the Eurasian sky. (Truth: the treasure is the Constitution of the Earth Federation, and the black metal box is Satellite 6.) (Misinterpretation: the treasure is Illuminati, hidden in the Subterra Station.)
- A message that only Susan would understand, that she needs to fulfill a promise, gift a treasure to **the people between the city lights.** (Truth: city lights are stars. Susan knows this because she was the one who told Marco that city lights look like stars on the ground. People between the city lights are alien civilisations.) (Misinterpretation: the people between the city lights are patients of the disease, so Susan studies them.)
