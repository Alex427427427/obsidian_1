## History
##### Excursion Disaster
Was a primary school teacher, known as Miss Liam. The military base she took her students on an excursion to turns out to be still active. Furthermore, the other teacher accompanying them was an Oceanian spy. So the Eurasian military set the room they were in on fire. Miss Liam valiantly carried students out, but appears to be critically injured and never seen again. 
##### Joining the Eurasian Government
She was offered Hero of the Eurasian Nation, and a position at the government. She took it, and climbed her way up to the Director of Information and Statistics. She discovers deep corruption and mismanagement of resources leading to an ecological catastrophe. 
##### Deciphering the End of World War and Obtaining the Audio Weapon
One day, when looking at the genetic trends of the Eurasian population, she noticed that there was a drastic increase in deafness after the war that wiped out nearly all humanity. She concluded that what ended it was an audio weapon. She discovers the song deep in her department's archives. 
##### Understanding the Audio Weapon
She took the song to Professor Lambda. The two find out its capabilities - they will trap the listener's consciousness in a different space called the Frequency Domain, while their bodies die. 
##### Conspiracy
With hatred towards the Eurasian Nation and hopelessness for humanity, she devises a plan. She gets Professor Lambda on her plan. She recruits the Illuminati, who are in the process of reviving the continental speaker network. She makes sure that it will be constructed, and hope that then she will play the song and send the world into the Frequency Domain.
