___
Under the Lumina Junction, there is the broken Subterra Station. In there, there are cryogenic vaults. 

The Illuminati has recognized Lucas as someone with qualities befitting of their society, and asks him to join them. Lucas says he is loyal to the Eurasian Federation. The Illuminati assures him that so are they, and tells him his value lies in his position in the DAP, and his sincere devotion to its citizens.

Lucas asks them what their goals are. They explain that their goal is to establish the Earth Federation, their unfinished dream since WW3's end. 

After contemplation, Lucas says that he will work alongside them so long as they can provide information regarding Marco's death, and that he can have answers for Susan. The Illuminati joins him in lamenting Marco, and says that is more than enough. 

The first assignments to Lucas are: the Illuminati has identified aspects of Eurasia that are abnormal. They want Lucas to investigate them, and at the same time, if abnormalities related to their own operations are found by the public, help come up with alternative explanations.
