我祝愿你的每一个梦
都不会一场空

天上人间，如果真值得歌颂
也是因为有你才会变得闹哄哄

人有悲欢离合
月有阴晴圆缺
此事古难全
但愿人长久

As time went on when I taught your class, 
I saw what you could all become...
and fell in love with Eurasia. 

When I killed,
when I lied,
when I clawed my way to power,
when I bled this continent dry...
every act, every sin,
you were the ones I did it for. 

I wanted a world worthy of you... 
who showed me the true joy of being alive...

An empire that doesn't belong just to any one person or a group of people...
A human empire... 
Where dreams are reality...
and violence is an impossibility...
