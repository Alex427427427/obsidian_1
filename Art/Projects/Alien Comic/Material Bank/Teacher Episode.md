___
Primary reunion. Missing teacher. Class asks Lucas to find. 

Remember past excursion during which the Eurasian secret police set fire to the place they were visiting, possibly an alien site. Half the class died, while the teacher and Miss Liam valiantly carried students out. Miss Liam supposedly died. Teacher was unharmed. 

Lucas finds teacher. Teacher tries to commit suicide. Lucas saves him. 

Lucas deduces the teacher is an Oceanian spy, who suggested the excursion to collect information for Oceania, about Eurasia's secret military bases. The teacher refuses to see the students again, claiming he never cared about them and he hated Eurasia. Nevertheless, Lucas convinces the teacher to visit the students.
