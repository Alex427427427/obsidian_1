Marco: 

In leaving this world, I have taken a precious treasure with me. But I leave behind something for my friend Lucas, something he would enjoy - a puzzle. And for my dearest... sweetest... bravest Susan, I leave behind the most precious gift of all: a secret about the world. 



We have collectively decided there was one hundred percent no cosmic purpose, and even if there was, it will be forever unknowable. The decision was made, perhaps too hastily, I think. We haven't the faintest idea one way or another... 

Now people lead uninspired, momentarily gratifying lives, drowning out their desperation. The purposes they made for themselves are at times noble, at times timid, petty, borderline masturbatory... 

Mysticism, superstition, religion and tribal violence have returned - those cultural excrements of human history - all because our secular leaders refuse to provide an alternative. 

Consider a vast universe. Vastness proportional to the importance of the elusive goal it exists for. It took x billion years for galaxies and stars to settle into the present configuration. x trillion parameters cast out, so that a few of them may yield the conditions for more complex, higher order organisation. I suspect intelligent civilisations will have a role to play in the cosmic symphony.
