___
Susan with deep eye bags, exhausted, leaning against a wall in a location on campus or crawling into bed. 

She thought she had made it when she got the offer to become a researcher at the Eurasian Academy of Sciences. But you will never make it - making it doesn't exist. She thought she could front load doing hard work so that one day she can coast at her job and relax. But instead, the hard work will remain hard till the end of her career. And she will never be good enough to coast - she will need to constantly read new papers to keep up to date in her field. She is tired of it all.
