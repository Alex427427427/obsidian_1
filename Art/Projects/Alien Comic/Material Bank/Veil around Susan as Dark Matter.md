Use veil around Susan as example of dark matter. 
## Marco's Messages
##### A poem for Susan, clue for Lucas - City Lights
At the Factory Array 
A place of glorious industry
I insert a blueprint
of a very special thing
And I wait

When the sun sets
I collect the fruit of my labour
My conspiracy is complete
And the shadows lengthen in Eurasia

I come to you with my gift
It would mean the world to me
If you would wear it often
**It is a robe made with the blackness of space.**

I wrap the robe around you
You wrap your arms around me. 
Above us, the city lights shine like stars. 
And beneath them, we have become ghosts.

(Kneeling beside Susan's corpse, when Lucas touches her dress, he notices how the dress glistens in the light.)
##### A message for Lucas
Once, Susan told me a childish idea. 
It captivated me so much, 
I never saw the city the same way. 
##### Gifts
To Lucas, I leave behind a great treasure where all paths converge. 
And to my dearest Susan, I give my most precious gift - a secret about the world. 
##### City Lights
In the quiet night we look upward
The sky is dark between city lights 
The universe is vast and so are we

What is that thing I hold, you ask?
It is a robe made with the blackness of space. 

I wrap the robe around you 
You wrap your arms around me 
Above us, the city lights shine like stars 
And beneath them, we have become ghosts
