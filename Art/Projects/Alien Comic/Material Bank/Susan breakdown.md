**Susan:** “What?”

Lucas stiffens — he realises what he’s accidentally revealed.

**Susan (quietly, accusing):** “You’re still investigating Marco’s death?”

**Lucas:** “Susan—”

**Susan (cutting him off, voice rising):** “You _promised_ me. You _swore_ you’d leave it alone. You know how dangerous it is. You know what they’re capable of.”

**Lucas:** “I know. I tried to stay out of it, but... there were too many questions. Too many pieces that didn’t fit. What Marco left behind, it wasn’t random — it felt like a message. Something important. He wouldn't have wanted me to walk away.”

**Susan (furious, hurt):** “And what about _what I_ want? Do you have any idea what it’s like? Lying awake every night wondering if they’re coming for me next? Wondering if I’m already being watched? You’re not the only one who lost him.”

**Lucas:** “I’m being careful. I have allies. The Eurasian Nucleus—”

**Susan:** “And enemies! The Nucleus, the secret police, who knows who else! You're poking a nest of vipers, Lucas!”

**Lucas (softly, almost to himself):** “I’d never put you in danger. But I need to know the truth. You asked me to stop... but even then, I could see it in your eyes — you didn’t believe it either. And Marco wasn’t just your husband. He was my friend too.”

**Susan slaps Lucas. The sound is sharp. They both freeze.**

**Susan (voice breaking, eyes down):** “You’re just like him. Always keeping secrets. Always convinced you’re the only one who can fix things... like you’re at war with the whole damn world.”

(She takes a shaky step toward him.)

**Susan:** “You think I care about the truth? I cared about _him._ About our life. And now he’s dead — and the truth won’t bring him back.”

(She grabs his coat with trembling hands.)

**Susan:** “I tried so hard to make him see what he was giving up. To make him _choose_ me. And now I’ve lost him. I can’t lose you too.”

(She buries her face in his chest, crying.)

**Susan (muffled):** “Please... please...”

(Lucas starts to hold her — then stops himself. Instead, he gently takes her by the shoulders, lifts her face, and wipes her tears.)

**Lucas:** “You won’t lose me, Susan.”

**Susan stares at him, searching his eyes.**

**Lucas:** “I’m not going anywhere.”

(They stand in silence for a long moment.)

**Susan (quietly):** “The source of the disease… that’s what Marco found, isn’t it? That’s what all of this was about. If we know what it is... then maybe... maybe we could leave. Somewhere far from here. Somewhere safe.”

(She tries to smile, tentative.)

**Susan:** “I've always wondered what life is like in Oceania. Will you come with me? We could publish the research. Finally put this all behind us. Start over.”

---

**Narration:** _Susan was wrong. The truth still hid in the city's darkness. But in that moment, for Lucas, there was only one choice._

**Lucas:** “Yeah. Thanks to you, my work in Eurasia is done. There’s nothing left for me here.”

**Lucas (gently):** “We’ll go. Quietly. Quickly.”



### Correction
Susan says she has made plans to move away to Oceania with the kids. 
Susan: "Will you come with us?"
Lucas thinks this is all very sudden.
