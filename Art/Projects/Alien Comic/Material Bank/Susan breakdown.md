*{Lucas just told Susan about something that by proxy revealed that he had been investigating Marco's death, against Susan's wishes. She loses it.}*

Susan: "What?"
Lucas realises what he has accidentally revealed. 
Susan (disbelief, accusatory): "Are you still investigating Marco's death?"
Lucas: "..."
Susan
Susan (anger, shocked): "You promised me! You swore to me you wouldn't dig into it. You know how dangerous it is - how dangerous *they* are!"
Lucas: "I know, and I tried to stay out of it, but... But there were too many questions, too many... you see, what Marco left behind... there were many puzzles... deliberately... a lot of it was very bizarre. A lot of it... felt very important. He wouldn't have wanted me to stop digging."
Susan (anger): "But what about what *I* want? Do you have any idea what it's like, lying awake at night, wondering if they're coming after you next? Or if I'll to have to bury another person I..."
Lucas: "Susan, I'm being careful. I have a powerful ally in the Eurasian Nucleus -" 
Susan: "And enemies everywhere else! In the Nucleus, the secret police, and, and who knows who else!"
Lucas (looking down, low voice, in pain): "... I wouldn't put you, or myself, in danger. But I need to know the truth. You told me to leave things be, but you didn't look happy about it. Plus, Marco was my friend too, not just your husband-"
Susan slaps Lucas. 
Susan (looking down, a tear rolling down her cheek): "You are just like him... Always walking around with some secret... Like running a one-man conspiracy against the rest of the world... (begins walking towards him) You think my happiness... You think I care about the truth? What about life? Marco is dead. No truth will bring him back. What matters are the people that are still alive. Marco didn't see what he was throwing away... (She clutches Lucas' coat) How? How could I have made him see? (She buries her crying face into Lucas' chest) A life... with me..."
Lucas raises his hands, about to comfort her, but decides against it.
Susan (still crying, hugging Lucas): "...Nothing in my life is going my way... I can't lose you too. Please... Please..."
Lucas (slowly pushes her away until she is up facing him to wipe her tears): "You won't lose me, Susan." 
Susan looks at him.
Lucas: "I'm not going anywhere." 
Susan leans in and kisses him. 
They stay like this for a while.
Susan (quietly): "Now that we know the source of the disease... that's what Marco was trying to uncover, right? Surely... your work here is done. Maybe we could leave... Somewhere safe. Somewhere far away. I've always wondered what life is like in Oceania. Will you come with me? And then we can publish our findings. And then... put all this behind us."

Narration: Susan was wrong. The truth still hides within the city's darkness. But in this moment for Lucas, there was only one right choice. 

Lucas: "Let's go. Let's go quickly and quietly."
