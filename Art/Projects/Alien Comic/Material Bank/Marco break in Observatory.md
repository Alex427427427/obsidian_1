{This is actually a great scene just after Susan's death, before the final act begins.}

**Lucas**: "Marco, this is crazy... What are we even doing here? We're breaking the rules."

**Marco**: "Only if we get caught. And what's so wrong with what we're doing? The pursuit of science has no curfew." 

**Lucas**: "Somehow, I don't think you'll be doing productive scientific work in there."

Marco succeeds in opening the lock. 

**Marco**: "Nonsense! Hehehe... We're going to seize the universe tonight, Lucas!"

They step inside the observatory dome. The air is cool and still. Above them, the starlight pokes through a wide slit in the dome, casting faint beams of light across the room.

**Lucas**: "Wow."

**Marco**: "Yeah." 

**Marco**: "One day, I'm going to figure it all out."

**Lucas**: "Huh?"

**Marco**: "All the mysteries of the universe. Where dark matter comes from, what the nature of time is, you name it."

**Lucas**: "You?"

**Marco**: "Why not? Every question has an answer. It's just a matter of finding it."

**Lucas**: "That's too ambitious even for you. What if the answers are impossible to reach? What if you spend your whole life chasing something... completely fruitless?"

**Marco**: "What if this, what if that, what if the moon was made of cheese? If we can't figure it out, then maybe we make contact with aliens and *they* have figured it out and they will tell us all about it." 

**Lucas**: "You with the aliens again... Even if they do exist, what makes you think they'll share anything with us?"

**Marco**: "The way I see it, Lucas... Life oughta be interesting!"

**Lucas**: "And how does one make life interesting?"

**Marco**: "Well, you needa have dreams, and give'em your all! You're giving up over here before you even began! That's no way to live man. Needa have companions too. That's your problem Lucas, you try to do everything by yourself. Just like our assignments. Come on, you help me with physics, I help you with engineering."

**Lucas**: (smiling) "What is this, Newton's Third Law of collusion?" 

**Marco**: "Exactly! Every action, my friend... Hahaha! Just kidding. I know you have principles. 

**Marco**: "Seriously though, it's no fun going through life on your own. That's why I... (pulls out tickets) got us tickets to the med ball."

**Lucas**: "What on earth have we got to do with the Faculty of Medicine?" 

**Marco**: "Smart and beautiful med students. I heard Susan is going. But I bet you're too scared." 

**Lucas**: (grabbing a ticket) "I'm not!"
