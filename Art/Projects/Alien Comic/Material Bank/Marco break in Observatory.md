{This is actually a great scene just after Susan's death, before the final act begins.}

**Lucas**: "This is crazy... What are we even doing here? We're breaking the rules."

**Marco**: "Only if we get caught. What's so wrong with what we're doing? The pursuit of science has no curfew." 

**Lucas**: "Somehow, I don't think you'll be doing productive scientific work in there."

Marco succeeds in opening the lock. 

**Marco**: "Nonsense! Hehehe... We're going to seize the universe tonight, Lucas!"

They step inside the observatory dome. The air is cool and still. Above them, the starlight pokes through a wide slit in the dome, casting faint beams of light across the room.

**Lucas**: "Wow."

**Marco**: "Yeah."

They stand in silence for a moment, looking up at the stars. The room feels like the universe itself, quiet and infinite.

**Lucas**: "You know what's funny? We can see all these stars, trillions of them. And yet, most of the universe is made of dark matter - something totally invisible to us. Isn't that wild?" 

**Marco**: "If we can't see this dark matter, how do we know it's there?"

**Lucas**: "Gravity. It’s like... imagine you’re holding a box, but you can’t look inside. You know it’s full because you can feel the weight."

**Marco**: "So we’re measuring all this gravity, but not enough stars and planets to account for it?"

**Lucas**: "Five times more gravity, actually."

**Marco**: "5 times! What is this substance exactly? It must be everywhere."

**Lucas**: "No one knows. Around just about every galaxy."

**Marco**: "That's crazy. The universe is full of mysteries..."

They star gaze for a while.

**Marco**: "One day, I'm going to figure it all out."

**Lucas**: "Huh?"

**Marco**: "Dark matter."

**Lucas**: "You think you'll crack a secret the universe has kept hidden for billions of years?"

**Marco**: "Why not? Every lock has a key. It's just a matter of finding it."

**Lucas**: "What if there’s no key? What if this is impossible to figure out? What if you spend your whole life chasing something... and humanity never gets far enough to even test your theories?"

**Marco**: "What if this, what if that, what if the world was flat? If we can't figure it out, then maybe we make contact with aliens and *they* have figured it out and they will tell us all about it."

**Marco**: "The way I see it, Lucas... Life oughta be interesting. You gotta have dreams, and give'em your all! You're giving up even before you began! That's no way to live man. Needa have companions too. That's your problem Lucas you try to do everything by yourself. Come on, I help you with engineering, you help me with physics."

**Lucas**: (smiling) "What is this, Newton's Third Law of collusion?" 

**Marco**: "Exactly! Every action, my friend... Hahaha! Just kidding. I know you have principles. Seriously though, it's no fun going through life on your own. That's why I was thinking... (pulls out tickets) I got us tickets to the med ball. Full of smart and beautiful med students. I heard Susan is going. But I bet you're too scared to go." 

**Lucas**: (grabbing a ticket) "I'm not!"
