##### Situation
At the lowest point, Lucas is on house arrest in an unknown apartment. There are two guards watching over Lucas. Patricia is responding to DAP's offensive, ready to execute her conspiracy in a few days. Lucas has just realised that the key to defeating her is delivering the angular coordinates of Satellite 6 in the sky to the Factory Array. His friend from the DAP managed to locate him, and tries to communicate with him in a few apartments over. 
##### Lucas Distracts the Guards
Ever since Lucas' realisation, he has been doing nothing but watch the recorded tv segment where he presents the deduction of the location of Satellite 6. The guards think he has gone mad, indulging in himself. But actually, he is providing a view from the window, of the thing he wants Factory Array to see. 
##### Friend Tries to Talk to Lucas
Lucas' friend from the DAP sets up a few apartments to the left. Manages to use a device to communicate with him, and instructs him on a set of communication protocols, like using body movements to denote symbols. Lucas tells the friend to go to the Factory Array to manufacture ear protection (from Patricia's song), but the only important part is that the Factory Array knows where Lucas is. 
##### Factory Array Sends Drones
The Factory Array, knowing where Lucas is, tries to come find him by sending drones. Lucas doesn't acknowledge it, and only looks at the tv and touches it. The drone sees the information it needs. Then it pretends to try to communicate with Lucas, which the guards notice and shoot down before any can happen. 
##### Friend caught, and killed by Patricia
Patricia brings the friend to Lucas, showing him that there is no hope for him, not knowing that Lucas' plan had already succeeded.
