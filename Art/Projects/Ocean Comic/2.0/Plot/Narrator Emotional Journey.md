### Start: Latent Fear and Apathy
Introduction:
The protagonist appears composed, but his latent thalassophobia reveals itself in small moments—hesitating to engage in fieldwork, avoiding conversations about personal goals, and feeling detached from the world around him. His emotional numbness manifests as apathy toward his own happiness.

Example inner monologue: "Why does it matter if I’m here or not? The ocean existed long before me and will exist long after."

Call to Action:
When the professor disappears, the protagonist reluctantly agrees to investigate, driven more by obligation than concern. His latent fear bubbles to the surface as he notices eerie, unexplained phenomena surrounding the ocean. 
### Fears Surface
Descent into the Ocean:
Submerged in the dreamlike ocean, the protagonist begins to feel the overwhelming weight of its vastness. The alien environment mirrors his own emotional void, amplifying his sense of insignificance.

Example inner monologue: "What am I compared to this? A fleeting breath in an endless tide."
### Breaking Point: Realisation of his Fears and Desperation
Separated from his companion during an encounter with a nightmarish creature, he’s forced to confront his deepest fears. The crushing silence and darkness trigger a breakdown.

Example inner monologue: "Why do I keep running? What am I afraid of? I’ve been avoiding everything—because it hurts to admit I’m alone." 
### Enlightenment
His companion finds him in his despair and urges him to look beyond the fear. Curiosity, they argue, is what gives life meaning, even in the face of vast uncertainty.

Companion’s words: "The ocean doesn’t want to destroy you. It’s indifferent. But you—you can choose to look at it, to explore it, to understand it. That’s how we face the unknown."

With renewed determination, the protagonist channels his fear into curiosity. Instead of shrinking away, he begins to observe the ocean and its alien beauty, piecing together its mysteries.
### Aftermath
He resumes his studies with a newfound passion, driven by a desire to understand the ocean—not as a means to escape his life, but as a curious and respectful pursuit.

- Final thought: "Fear is a signal, that there is another frontier waiting to be crossed."
