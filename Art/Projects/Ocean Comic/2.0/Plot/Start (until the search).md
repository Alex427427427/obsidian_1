### Missing Professor
An empty podium.
Narration: "It had been months since Professor Landon last showed up to his classes."

Professor Fara walks onto stage. 
Narration: "As usual, Professor Fara substituted for him. And as usual, almost compulsively..."

The narrator stands at the door to the lecture hall.
Narration: "I found myself listening in at the start."

The lecture slide reads "Modern Fluid Dynamics - Lecture 12: Turbulent Modes and Scale Amplification in Planetary Systems". The narrator leaves the room. 
Narration: "As if it would reveal anything about Landon's situation. To the students, he was on sick leave, but in reality..." 

Professor Landon head shot.
Narration: "He simply disappeared without notice."

The narrator walks away. 
Narration: "Where was he? What happened to him? No one in the faculty knew."

Landon's empty office.
Narration: "Only that he left behind strange photographs in his office." 

Grotesque oceanic organisms.
Narration: "They were of bizarre organisms, possibly oceanic, never-before-seen." 

An omnipresent voice of red colour appears on black panel: *When night falls, it is like a black ocean, descending upon mankind*
### Something was wrong with Professor Landon.
Narration: "In the weeks before his disappearance, Landon was often distant and distracted. 

The narrator remembers a conversation with Landon. 
Narration: "It was as if he needed to be somewhere else."

It was raining outside.
Narration: "It had been a rainy season."

"First, he started having memory problems. He didn't remember my name, nor my project that he was supervising. 

"This was troubling because my PhD depended on his guidance.

Narrator, Professor Fara and other colleagues ask Landon to go to lunch. Landon initially agrees, but when they come upon the outside and it rains, Landon sees it and declines the offer. 

The Narrator walked to the carpark in the rain, turned around, and saw Landon looking at him from his window. 

Narration: "If it rained in the evenings, he would rather stay in his office than to walk to the carpark, even if he had an umbrella." 

Narration: "His office began to have a strange odor. I couldn't really make out what it was. Had he stopped showering?

"Once, he collapsed during lunch break. 

"When we tried to give him water, he yelled and fought to get away from us."

The narrator looks at him pitifully. 
### The Professor Landon I knew
Narrator: "The Landon I knew remembered everything I said or did. The Landon I knew never . The Landon I knew... loved the ocean." 

Landon, in a lecture: "The ocean moves because it has to. Temperature, salinity and gravity create a dance of pressures that push currents through the depths and across the surface. Earth's rotation deflects these currents via the Coriolis effect. The ocean floor drags on them. Wind sculpts surface currents into ever-changing patterns. The heavenly bodies pull the earth along an aggregate direction, now here, now there, forming the oceans of the world into an every-so-slightly oval shield of water which the earth revolves within, creating tides. 

"Satisfying in its simplicity, baffling in its chaos and unpredictability, this account just about wraps it up for the physics of currents. As far as an undergraduate is concerned, this is the end of the story. 

"So why study oceanography?"

The narrator listens, mesmerised. 
Narration: "I never knew where I wanted to go nor felt like it mattered. Never set lofty goals for myself, nor developed passions, nor pondered my happiness. Iâ€™ve simply moved when I had to, along the path of least resistance. 

"As if in a haze, I made my way through high school and college. And there I was, about to start a PhD because of some old man's passionate speech.
### Study
Present day, the narrator stares at his half finished sentence on his thesis. The title of the document says: ON THE SHAPING OF DEEP CURRENTS BY OCEANIC LANDSCAPES. 

Narrator: Was that all? That was all I got done today...
Library speakers: "ATTENTION: THE LIBRARY WILL CLOSE IN 10 MINUTES. ALL SERVICES INCLUDING PRINTING AND BORROWING WILL TERMINATE IN 5 MINUTES." 

The narrator packs up. 
Narration: "Grinding until odd hours... Slowly chiseling away at some tired niche questions nobody asked for... Nibbling on my poorly justified grants... With an absent supervisor. This was fine for me." 

The narrator goes to zip up his pencil case. 

Narration: "Everything is just..."

He sees the USB hiding within, and freezes in terror. His gaze of the scene dissolves into a frame of the ominous ocean floor, oppressively dark and suspiciously vacant. 

He zips up the pencil case, leaves the library and walks through a campus in the evening. 
### Fara
At the car park, Fara stands in the distance eerily. The narrator notices her. 

Narration: "Fara tried to organise a visit to his house among his colleagues - anyone that might've known Landon's address." 

Colleague A: "He's probably recovering from some illness. Best not disturb." 

Colleague B: "I don't mean to be harsh, but I'm paid to do my research and teach my classes. Not to babysit someone else." 

Colleague C: "It's none of my business. And it's none of yours, either." 

Fara looks very disappointed. 

Fara, angry and walking out: "What kind of sick culture is this!" 

Narration: "Fara came from the Eurasian Federation." 

Narration: "I tried explaining to her that in contemporary Oceania, it's considered more appropriate to act disinterested in other people's affairs and mind someone's own business. If Landon could be reached, there would already be administrative procedures in motion. The best we could do was wait." 

Fara: "It's been months. Why haven't we heard anything?"

Narrator: "I - I don't know."

Fara: "Aren't you worried about him? I see you standing in my lectures." 

Narration: "I didn't have a good answer. After a long pause, I asked why she cared so much about him."

Fara: "He was my PhD supervisor. 

"Even though it was remote, he still took care of me, and by the end, gave me a position and brought me here."

Fara, with the narrator looking at her with understanding: "I owe my current life to him."
### Night Pondering
Narrator lies in bed. 

Narration: "What happened to Landon?"
Narration: "He lived by himself. Maybe he just couldn't get up one day and no one was there." 
Narration: "I didn't want to know. I didn't want to think about it. I couldn't stop thinking about it." 

Narration: "Why did I choose to study oceanography?"
Narration: "I think it's because of something Landon said near the end of that speech."
Narration: "What was it?" 

Narration: "... I couldn't remember." 

It begins raining outside. The narrator stares at it, and suddenly, sees the oppressive deep ocean again. The narrator turns in bed, anxious. 

The narrator thinks about Fara trying to get anyone to go check on him. 

Narration: "The truth was... I had an idea of where he went. Back when the admins searched his office, they found a letter addressed to me."

Narrator read it at home:
There is a place where bones do not fossilize. 
Where flesh does not decay. 
Where the sediment entombs memories older than memories.
