##### They arrive at Landon's strange submarine-like house and find him, who angrily tells them to leave. They and find clues of an abandoned classified project. The only inaccessible place is a locked bunker with password prompt "name of the ocean". They search until night fall. 

##### When the two attempt to leave, they find the outside to be an endless ocean. They recover from shock, test their situation and prove they are underwater. 

##### Fara breaks down, reveals she was once involved with Landon's project, cataloging images of marine organisms for an unknown purpose. 

##### Narrator proposes a way to enter the bunker, calming Fara. Using her experience with the project, Fara tries an ocean name for the password and it fails. They must observe organisms to deduce which region of the world they're currently in. 

##### They must turn on the external lights so they can see. Due to broken controls, giant metal coverings must be removed from the outside. Fara volunteers to enter the ocean and manually remove them. 

##### The narrator can hear Fara climbing the house exterior. But he hears a second sound approaching from the other side of the house. He goes out there to find her. Upon entering the ocean, his latent thalassophobia arises and he loses his shit. 

##### The creature attacks Fara. The narrator hands her a weapon, while he removes the coverings. While doing so, the narrator sees a glimpse of the ocean floor. Afterwards they return to the interior. 

##### Fara identifies organisms while the narrator is forever changed by the experience. Fara finds that they are in the South Atlantic, but the password still fails. Worse, a large organism shifts in the distance and approaches. 

##### The narrator breaks down at the unknowability of the ocean. Fara helps him regain his sanity.
