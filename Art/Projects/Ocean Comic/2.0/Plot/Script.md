##### Flash forward: the narrator and Professor Fara are in a descending submarine, dreadfully pondering what lies at the heart of the ocean. 
A red voice from nowhere says: 
Seven continents formed, when zero should have been enough. And organisms that ought to swim, have over the eons, walked onto land. 

A vampire squid floats and unfolds like a ghost outside a round window. 

The narrator uneasily observes it with dread. Professor Fara describes marine snow - the shower of decomposing organic material that surrounds them and fills all of the lower ocean. The narrator wonders if they are heading to where the marine snow is falling - the graveyard at the heart of the ocean. 

Title drop. 
##### Opening: The narrator studies oceanography with apathy. Professor Landon goes missing after handing the narrator a USB containing information regarding uncharted waters underneath the world's oceans. Substitute lecturer Fara urges the narrator to search for Landon. They exchange clues and depart for Landon's house. 
Narrator: "The ocean moves because it has to. Temperature, salinity and gravity create a dance of pressures that push currents through the depths and across the surface. Earth's rotation deflects these paths via the Coriolis effect. Wind sculpts surface currents into ever-changing patterns. The heavenly bodies pull the earth along an aggregate direction, now here, now there, forming the oceans of the world into an every-so-slightly oval shield of water which the earth revolves within, creating tides. 

Satisfying in simplicity, beautiful in chaos and unpredictability, this about wraps it up for the physics of currents. As far as I was interested, this was the end of the story. 

So why did I chose to study oceanography? 

I never knew where I wanted to go nor felt like it mattered. Never set lofty goals for myself, nor developed passions, nor pondered my happiness. Iâ€™ve simply moved when I had to, along the path of least resistance. 

As if in a haze, I made my way through high school, then college. Now here I am, pursuing a PhD. 






##### They arrive at Landon's strange submarine-like house and find him in a catatonic state telling them to leave. When Fara tends to Landon, the narrator finds clues of an abandoned classified project. The only inaccessible place is a locked bunker with password prompt "name of the ocean". They search until night fall. 

##### When the two attempt to leave, they find the outside to be an endless ocean. Landon has run off into the house. They recover from shock, test their situation and prove they are underwater. 

##### Fara breaks down, reveals she was once involved with Landon's project, cataloging images of marine organisms for an unknown purpose. 

##### Landon could only be in the bunker. Narrator proposes a way to enter the bunker, calming Fara. Using her experience with the project, Fara tries an ocean name for the password and it fails. They must observe organisms to deduce which region of the world they're currently in. 

##### They must turn on the external lights so they can see. Due to broken controls, giant metal coverings must be removed from the outside. Fara volunteers to enter the ocean and manually remove them. 

##### The narrator can hear Fara climbing the house exterior. But he hears a second sound approaching from the other side of the house. He goes out there to find her. Upon entering the ocean, his latent thalassophobia arises and he loses his shit. 

##### The creature attacks Fara. The narrator hands her a weapon, while he removes the coverings. While doing so, the narrator sees a glimpse of the ocean floor. Afterwards they return to the interior. 

##### Fara identifies organisms while the narrator is forever changed by the experience. Fara finds that they are in the South Atlantic, but the password still fails. Worse, a large organism shifts in the distance and approaches. 

##### The narrator breaks down when faced with the unknowability of the ocean. Fara helps him regain his sanity. They realise they are in the oceans beneath the known ones. 

##### They read the contents of the USB Landon gave the narrator. A large map opens up, categorising the hidden ocean into 20 or so sub oceans by current, with an even larger uncharted region. (Uncharted oceans ruled out due to Landon not knowing the names.) They use what they can see outside to compare with images of each sub ocean. 

##### Narrator goes outside to be ready to shut the covers when Fara signals she found which sub ocean it is. He reaches the final cover right before the creature plunges for one final attack, but the creature swallows him along with the house. 

##### When he comes to, the house has been spat out by the creature, who writhes painfully on the ocean floor. With the final covering illuminating their surroundings, the narrator sees the abyssal carpet, in the process of devouring the creature. He closes the cover and return inside. 

##### Fara reveals the abyssal carpet (with images) was the clue that they are in a specific sub ocean called the Marina Basin. They put the name into the password and find Landon kneeling beside the organs of Marina - thought to be his late mother, kept alive in organ form. 

##### Landon recounts his life, and explains that Marina is dreaming, transporting the house to the under-oceans. Fara and the narrator realise that they must disconnect Marina's life support, ending the dream and sending them back to the surface world. They successfully subdue a protesting Landon and kill Marina. In an abstract sequence, Landon tearfully bids farewell to a younger Marina, who forgives him. 

##### When they all come to, Marina's organs are gone. Years later, the narrator walks along the beach, admiring the ocean.
