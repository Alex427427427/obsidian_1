### Premise
Landon's PhD student - Narrator - and the substitute lecturer - Fara - search for Landon, arriving at his house and being trapped in the ocean at nightfall. 

They grapple with survival, discover the secrets and eventually find out the password of Marina Basin and enter the bunker, realising the truth that Marina is still alive in the form of organs. They somehow convince Landon to let Marina go, disconnecting life support, and the dream ends, sending them back to the surface world. 

### Fara Emotional Journey
Compassionate. But this comes from an unhealthy need for validation rather than genuine concern for others. 

Urges Narrator to search for Landon. 

Secretly involved with the Basin project, but unaware of the answers to the central mysteries. Her role in the project was to catalog the species of fish images sent to her. She didn't know these images were taken in Marina Basin. 

When it becomes clear that she caused them to be trapped in the ocean, she breaks down in guilt. 

Recovers after acknowledging that it was her all along that needed to be shown compassion for, and shown that there's a way out. 

At the climax in Landon's room, she's the one that tried to disconnect Marina's life support, because she recognises that's what Marina wants. Landon and Fara stand off in an abstract mental space, where Marina ultimately appears, discussing life and letting go. When Landon comes to, with tears, he witnesses Fara disconnecting the life support. 
### Narrator Emotional Journey
Detached analytical PhD student studying oceanography - how deep ocean currents affect climate patterns (deep ocean currents could have shaped the development of the earth's oceans). 

Poor knowledge of self emotional state. Haunted by an inability to connect with others emotionally, stemming from a cold or neglectful upbringing. 

Avoidant. Doesn't like assuming what other people need. Reluctantly agrees to search for Landon. 

Blames Fara for bringing them into this situation. 

Has latent fear of the deep ocean. Him being drawn to oceanography is a manifestation of morbid curiosity by his deepest fears. 

Breaks down when at a critical moment he must enter the ocean, he realises this intense fear and examines his entire life, feeling insignificant and hopeless. 

Fara explains to him how he can double down on his curiosity. "The ocean doesn’t want to destroy you. It’s indifferent. But you—you can choose to look at it, to explore it, to understand it. That’s how we face the unknown." 

At the climax in Landon's room, he initially helps Landon because Landon's struggles resonates with him, and he believes keeping Marina alive will keep the house from entering the abyssal carpet. Fara quickly converts him. Narrator restrains Landon while Fara disconnects the life support.
