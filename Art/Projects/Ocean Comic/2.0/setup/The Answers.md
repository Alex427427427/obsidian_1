___
There is a large hidden primordial ocean beneath the known oceans of the world, predating life. All marine species have traces in this ocean, including ones thought extinct, dating back to the Cambrian era. 

Old and lonely Professor Landon only has his loving mother, Marina. Marina has some unknown connection to the hidden ocean, in the form of SCIENTIFIC anomalies and NOT supernatural. When Marina is near death, Landon signs her up to a secret government research program out of grief. In this program, Marina is kept alive as organs, undergoing experimentation. They find that when Marina dreams, her surroundings along with her are transported to a deep ocean - the hidden ocean. This is found out due to spherical space missing after every night, around Marina, along with research member deaths. The research teams come to call it the Marina Basin. They converted Landon's house to a research facility in the desert, with submarine-like engineering, and begin studying the ocean nightly. 

Eventually the project is abandoned because the transportation was deemed not useful. Leaving only Landon and Marina in the house.

Landon struggles to keep Marina alive. At night, when the house is transported to the ocean, the currents seem to drag it somewhere. This somewhere is the bottom of Marina Basin, where a colossal superorganism of carpet shape over the ocean floor, feeds on marine snow and corpses of marine life, like a colony of microbes. Marina seeks death. Landon abandons his teaching role and remains at Marina's side, locking her organs in a bunker with a lock that only he can enter. The password is the name of the ocean - Marina Basin.

To anyone else, Landon pretends Marina passed away. Marina Basin is unknown knowledge.
