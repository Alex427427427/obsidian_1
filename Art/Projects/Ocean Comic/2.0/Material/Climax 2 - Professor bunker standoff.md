___
Fara and Narrator enter the bunker to find Landon kneeling beside an organic mass. They have just found out that the name of the ocean they're in is the Marina Basin. And they realise that they, now at the heart of the ocean, are in the presence of Marina - the organs kept alive by Landon. 

Narrator demands answers and Landon tells them not to disturb Marina's dreaming. 
The students suspect that the cause of their situation is Marina's dreaming, and that Marina is in pain. Landon angrily refuses to let the students take her away from him, because he will be alone.
