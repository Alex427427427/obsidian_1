我喜欢大海。

也许因为大海显示着这个世界的真相。在大海面前，生活的一切都变得无所谓。

”无所谓“就是世界的真相。我这辈子，从来没有什么理想，激情，对自己人生的要求，对幸福的思考。只有听着家长的话，稀里糊涂地往前走。

朦朦胧胧地，我读完了高中，大学本科，研究生，直到现在以海洋生物学的课题读博士。


I always found the ocean interesting, because it laid bare the truth of this world. Before its vast expanse, everything about life was irrelevant or inconsequential. What lurked within its expanse, was to a significant degree unknowable. 

Inconsequence and unknowability - those were the truths of this world. Me... I never knew where I wanted to go nor felt like it mattered. I’d never set lofty goals for myself, nor developed passions, nor pondered my happiness. I’ve simply followed the path laid out for me. 

As if in a haze, I made my way through high school, then college, then graduate school. Now, here I am, pursuing a PhD in oceanography.
