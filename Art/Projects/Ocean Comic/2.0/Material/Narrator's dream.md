In this dream, the narrator realises that all life forms are deformations of one another. He can no longer see animals as animals, but mangled and deformed humans. 

He dreams that he is stuck in a primordial ocean, as a small organism. By the end he sees the ocean floor and creepy humans crawling over it. Among them, one woman stands there, staring at him.
