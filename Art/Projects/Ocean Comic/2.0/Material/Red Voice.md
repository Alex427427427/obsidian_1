___
A voice that reaches the Narrator's mind. Actually Marina's voice, mostly mumbling about her situation from a cosmic / timeless perspective, and guiding the Narrator towards her prison when possible. 

### 1 At the start
Seven continents surfaced, when zero should have been enough. And organisms that ought to swim, have, over the eons, walked onto land. 

### 3 When Narrator sees Professor's Note for him
There is a place where bones do not fossilize. 
Where flesh does not decay. 
Where the sediment entombs memories older than land. 
### 3 When night falls
When night falls
It is like a black ocean
Descending upon mankind
### 4 When they find out they're trapped in ocean
This is not your dream
I’m the one who lies in this basin of flesh and blood
I lie
In the heart of the ocean
### 4 When they read stories of people that died
You are not the first 
To hear its question
Nor the first 
To drown in its answer
### 5 When water emerges into the hatch
The heart of the ocean beats
So that water can seep out of the earth’s pores
### 6 When narrator first enters the ocean
A basin that must’ve been older than humanity
Than primates, reptiles, invertebrates
The hearts of all life that would come to be, beating as one
We never should have left 
### 6 When Narrator Opens Light Covers
Eyes that have never seen sunlight
Eyes that do not blink
They see you now
### 7 When Narrator Spots Large Creature, and the Voice Grows Angry
Why do you walk here 
Why do you breathe here 
Why do you hope 
When I only devour

### 2 After Fara Encouragement and when narrator remembers his studies and professor
There is more water on earth than previously thought. 
The known oceans of the world make up one fourth.
The rest lies below them. 
### 7 When narrator enters the ocean for the final time
Night after night
I invite the house here
An invitation older than humanity
The heart of the ocean
Lies in me
### 8 When narrator is in the ocean
It is like an age of torture
a scandal of Cambrian proportions
When in the light, life wrestled and strangled and tore at itself
And in the dark, life drifted through the void 
The terror of loneliness and uncertainty
Only ended with you knowing 
the name of the ocean
A name I don’t remember anymore
Please, I can't stand this ancient stench any longer
### 8 When the Narrator Evades the Creature and it Plunges into the Abyssal Carpet. 
The heart beats faster 
The arteries tighten 
The body does not let go 
Of what it has swallowed.
### 9 After the Abyssal Carpet Swallows the Creature
Whether abundant ocean
or desolate land
no feeling is the end.

On longer time scales
even desert can become 
ocean again. 
### 10 When the bunker door opens
Welcome
And thank you
For reaching the heart of the ocean



### Other 2
What you call water 
Is its blood 
What you call currents 
are its breaths
What you call life 
Is its offspring
### Other 3
A memory older than memory itself 
Surges through your veins 
It was never yours to hold 
But it has always known your name.
### Other 6 - When the Ocean Seems Infinite
You measure depth in kilometers 
But you do not measure time in eons 
And you do not measure fear. 
### Other 7 - When the Narrator Hears Distant Inhuman Sounds
It is not sound 
It is a memory 
That echoes through pressure 
Through time.
