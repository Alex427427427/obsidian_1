___
A voice that reaches the Narrator's mind. Actually Marina's voice, mostly mumbling about her situation from a cosmic / timeless perspective, and guiding the Narrator towards her prison when possible. 

### 1 At the start
Seven continents formed, when zero should have been enough. And organisms that ought to swim, have, over the eons, walked onto land.
### 2 When narrator remembers his studies and professor
There is four times as much water on earth as previously thought. 
The known oceans of the world make up one fourth of that water.
The rest lie below them.
### 3 When night falls
When night falls
It is like a black ocean
Descending upon mankind
### 4 When they find out they're trapped in ocean
This is not your dream
I’m the one who lies in this basin of flesh and blood
I lie
In the heart of the ocean
### 5 When water emerges into the hatch
The heart of the ocean beats
So that water can seep out of the earth’s pores
### 6 When narrator first enters the ocean
A basin that must’ve been older than humanity
Than primates, reptiles, invertebrates
The hearts of all life that would come to be, beating as one
We never should have left 
### 7 When narrator enters the ocean for the final time
Night after night
I invite the house here
An invitation older than humanity
The heart of the ocean
Lies in me
### 8 When narrator is in the ocean
It is like an age of torture
a scandal of Cambrian proportions
When in the light, life wrestled and strangled and tore at itself
And in the dark, life drifted through the void 
The terror of loneliness and uncertainty
Only ended with you knowing 
the name of the ocean
A name I don’t remember anymore
### 9 When narrator finally evades the creature
Whether abundant ocean...
or desolate land... 
No feeling is the end.
Because, on longer time scales...
Desert... 
Becomes ocean...
Becomes desert...
Becomes ocean again.
### 10 When the bunker door opens
Welcome
And thank you
For reaching the heart of the ocean
