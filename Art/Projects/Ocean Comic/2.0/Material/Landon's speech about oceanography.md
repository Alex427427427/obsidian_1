A thread.

The narrator says that the speech made him study oceanography. 

Initially the narrator doesn't remember which part of the speech made him study oceanography. 

Later he remembers it was a huge discovery. What was it? 

Finally he remembers Landon telling him about the hidden oceans of the world, giving him the USB for him to study it, but he was too afraid to open it.
