### Prof's Note?
The horizon is a lie.  
A line drawn to keep you from asking  
What lies beyond it.

His words ran off the page,  
Like water,  
Like they were never meant to stay in this world.

Or did the ocean simply open,  
And let him in?

### When Narrator Ponders the Infinity of the Ocean
Nowadays, I find myself visiting the beach, admiring the ocean. 
The waves come from somewhere far away, breathing in rhythms I’ve come to find both haunting and comforting. 

Marina Basin feels even more distant, its horrors softened by time. 

Is it still down there, I wonder? 
Or did it collapse in on itself and vanish, pulled into the void along with Marina herself?

Landon passed away quietly a while ago. 

His deep gaze and strained smiles - now faint echoes lost to the afternoon rays shining on an empty hospital bed. 

We visited him till the end. 

Sometimes, I question what was real. Was that hidden ocean just a nightmare? 

No, it couldn't have been, because Marina's organs were absent when we woke up. 

Maybe the surface world is the real illusion. 
A thin membrane, fragile and translucent, stretched over an endless deep blue. 
What better pursuit to devote my life to, than to peel back the membrane? 
I’ve always been standing on the edge. 

I wonder if Landon reunited with the one ocean that loved him the most. 
The one waiting for him at the heart of it all.
