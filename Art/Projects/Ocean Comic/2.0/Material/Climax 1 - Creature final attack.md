Narrator needs to close the coverings of the lights on the outside of the house. 

The creature swims upwards for one more attack. Narrator needs to reach the final covering, close it, so that Fara can maneuver the submarine house out of the line of the creature's attack. 

Back when Narrator opened the final covering, his cord was at the limit. The covering opened away from him. So now, when he needs to close it, he is unable to reach it. 

He brought a tool with him for this purpose, but the tool was lost due to a struggle at closing the previous covering. 

Narrator has to cut his cord, leap towards the edge of the lid, so that he can close it with his hands. 

Right as he sees the creature turn around to face him from a distance and begins charging, he closes the lid and Fara activates the nuclear propulsion. The creature just misses the submarine/house, plunges into the graveyard at the ocean floor. 

The Narrator tries his hardest to cling onto the lid, but momentarily loses grip. Floating in absolute darkness and silence, he remains mindful and calm, accepting his doom which was dictated long ago. 

The red voice ([[Red Voice]]) says: 
"Whether abundant ocean...
or desolate land... 
No feeling is the end.
Because, on longer time scales...
Desert... 
Becomes ocean...
Becomes desert...
Becomes ocean again."

Narrator comes to, realising that Fara came out and caught him in the last moment.
