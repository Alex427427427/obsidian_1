Culmination of Professor Landon's sad flashbacks. 

Anger and regret, for how his life turned out. What he feared the most happened. He lived an unhappy life. 

His mum was all-forgiving. 
She asks him to create art. 

Landon paints like a badass, like Irving from Severance. His mum sees it, studies it for a moment and says "I love it."

In the final flashback (which should happen as Fara and the Narrator find out which ocean they are in), we see Landon finish his painting. It is a creepy deep sea. His mum loves it. He explains that it is a place that no one remembers but everyone must go. And he names it after her - Marina.
