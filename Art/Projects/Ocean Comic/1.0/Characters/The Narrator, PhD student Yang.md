## Core belief
I am insignificant. 
##### Cause
My upbringing in a household that had no respect for my agency has drilled into me that my own dreams and needs are not worthy of attention. My household was an unusually alien place, because within it, “I” didn’t exist. My parents assigned what I was feeling and thinking. I needed to be perceptive of what my parents wanted, so that I didn’t get in trouble. Figuring things out gave me a sense of control. However, there were times that I could not predict my parents’ thoughts. This magnified my feeling of insignificance.

The Ignorant
## Ending perspective on the theme
The Scholar
## Manifestations
I have a calm and unflappable demeanor. It’s hard to be emotionally roused when you see your own life as irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. I am content going through my PhD, researching an unbelievably niche topic - oceanography - remaining nameless and utterly irrelevant but achieving what my father considers the pinnacle of success. I dislike when people project onto me, thinking they know how I feel, or what I need, never asking what I want. But I’ve come to accept it. I believe that humanity is insignificant in the face of the cosmic unknown. 
## Story Role
