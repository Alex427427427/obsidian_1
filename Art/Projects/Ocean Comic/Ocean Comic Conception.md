## Title
Heart of the Ocean
## Motivations
1. Draw a cosmic horror + thalassophobia related story, involving a primordial ocean hidden below all known oceans of the world, larger than all combined.
2. Implement various thalassophobia/cosmic horror passages I thought up over the years that invoke a creepy feeling in me 
3. Explore fear of loneliness
4. Have a final scene of the narrator walking on the beach, admiring the ocean views. 
## Themes
[[Lovelessness]] and [[Humanity's Triumph]]. Fear of loneliness and the unknown. 
##### How should someone handle the fear of loneliness? 
###### The Anxious Clinger Perspective
Loneliness is a source of anxiety and despair. Cling onto company regardless of whether the company is willing. Do not fundamentally address the fear. Unhealthy. Type 2. Eventually they will lose what they’re clinging to, and be at a crossroads of perspectives, or self destruction and death. 
###### The Self Sufficient Perspective
Loneliness can turn into solitude when you realise it’s an opportunity for introspection and self development. Healthy. Unhealthy if secretly one of the other perspectives in denial. 
###### The Loving Perspective
Loneliness is scary, social bonds are essential to well being, so I’m going to practise empathy and connection. Healthy. Type 2. May turn unhealthy if my efforts miss the mark and are not paying off. May be unhealthy to begin with if I have pride and think I know what other people need, or be overly involved with their lives. 
###### The Ignorant Perspective
Loneliness is scary, so I’m going to avoid thinking about it and drift through my life. Never address the fear. Unhealthy. Upon a disruptive event or deeper inspection, I may turn into any of the other perspectives. 
###### The Scholar Perspective
If you fear the unknown, study it. What is the range of possibilities / versions of a lonely existence? What does each entail? When you turn the unknown into the known, you can better prepare for it, and it’s not so scary anymore is it? Type 5.
