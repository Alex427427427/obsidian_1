## Core belief
My life is not worth living. 
##### Cause
Though I am a researcher, the thing I wanted most was not knowledge, but… love. A lifetime of failed romantic pursuits, and the eventual fulfilment of my greatest fear - a loveless life and a lonely death - means I can only look back on my life with intense regret, frustration, self pity and despair. 
## Personality 
Type 2
## Starting perspective on the theme
The Anxious Clinger
## Ending perspective on the theme
Uncertain, but has made a final choice that indicates change. 
## Manifestations
My core belief has blown my sanity. At night, I read / watch snippets of families/couples posting photos of their happy and funny memories. Love is just a thing that others do; I am only fit to scavenge the remains of other people’s living activity, like eating cultural excrement.
## Story Role
Type 2 terrified of loneliness and thinks that his life is not worth living after a lifetime of failure finding love. Ironically, just after he learns that he had experienced love from his mother, she becomes ill. He accepts a research opportunity to keep her organs alive. Every night, her dreams transport the house to the oldest ocean below the known world’s oceans, sinking towards somewhere. He stays by her side night after night, determined to be swallowed by the ocean some day. In the end, after his students' persuasion, he makes a choice between loneliness or annihilation, and bravely chooses loneliness.
