## Core belief
If I don’t do everything I can to seem kind and helpful to others, I am unlovable. 
##### Cause
Growing up, I was not particularly exceptional in any way, whether in talent, beauty, or knowing how to have fun. To my peers, I was dull. In order to be worthy of friendship, I thought I had to stand out in some way. So I tried to be as helpful and kind as possible. This had varying success. When it was successful, it confirmed my belief. When it was unsuccessful, instead of questioning my belief, I thought it revealed that I was all the more difficult to love, such that all my giving was not enough, so I needed to try even harder.
