光辉国

Inspo from Mebius opening

Alien protag came from the luminous nation, which at the end is revealed to be an empire built by future humans. 

Their true mission was to come to Earth, to prevent the imprisonment of earth by the universal order (for genocidal crimes against another alien race in primordial times). Not even the universal order knew that the luminous nation has origins on earth.
