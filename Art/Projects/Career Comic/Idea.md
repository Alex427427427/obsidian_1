## Beginning
"I only have one life. I must not waste it."
Painstaking search for a cosmic purpose and the best career.
## Realisation
"There is no higher destination. Only one another."
"I only have one life. I must not waste it."
## Epilogue
One more thing. My struggles are likely not unique to myself. If I record my wrestle with meaning for others to reflect upon in the future, then my life has not been wasted.
