___
## To Invoke Fear
The ocean is vast and unknown, full of potential danger and possible discoveries of terror. 
## To Represent Warmth
If a desolate desert can be used to represent the lack of some substance that one intensely longs for (like love), the ocean may represent the satisfaction of that need. The ocean envelops anyone - like an embrace. 
## To Represent Space
The ocean is vast and unknown, like the starry sky. It glistens under light. It meets the night sky at the horizon. 
## To Represent Strong Emotion
The ocean moves with great force. Nothing can stop it.
