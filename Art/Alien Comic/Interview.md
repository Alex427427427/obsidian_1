Lucas is interviewed for a job at the government. 

Patricia: "What is the role of government?"
A: "To maximise the freedom of everyone; basically, their ability to acquire wealth and do whatever they want. The government must cater."
Patricia: "What is the role of government?"
B: "To carry out the will of the majority. It's impossible to cater to everyone, so the government should do whatever the majority wants."
Patricia: "What is the role of government?"
C: "To protect culture and tradition. It will disintegrate on its own, and without it we are nothing."
Patricia: "What is the role of government?"
D: "To do whatever it takes."

"What is the role of government?"
Lucas: "Depends on the times."
"Oh? How so?"
Lucas: "In prosperous times, promote the freedom of actualisation for individuals. In trying times... Take matters into your own hands and do whatever it takes to ensure the survival of the species."
Ian: "And tell us Lucas. Are we in prosperous times or trying times?"
Lucas: "Production is at an all-time high. People are free to wander through life from one field of work to another, without much purpose, but without much agony either. Certain genetic defects have completely disappeared from the population. No natural disasters plague us, no sign of war... The bureaucracy has expanded into hyper-specialised roles, because we can afford to... It would seem that Eurasia is in a golden age."

Later, privately.
Patricia: "'Trying times' huh... Scary."
Lucas: "It's not necessarily my own vision, it's just what I observed from you guys. If I'm gonna work for you, might as well follow your vision, right?"
Patricia: "But I wanna know what you think. What fundamental philosophy should drive a government?"
Lucas: "Uh... I don't really know what philosophy results in a good government. Different times have different philosophies, all with varying levels of success, and will each appear to make perfect sense or be disgusting to people of an era. I just know that in the long term, societies that happen to pick the right decisions will survive, and those that don't..."
Patricia: "Can you be more specific?"
Lucas: "Uh... a good government should kinda just fulfill those necessary biological functions of a society that the individual search for dopamine can't take care of. Memory of history, gathering info from the environment, facilitating science... Large scale projects... Public transport... uh... making sure people don't waste their lives on gambling and video games?... Sorry. I thought I was being interviewed for my analytical skills, not political philosophy..."
Patricia, amused: "You mentioned earlier that in prosperous times and trying times, the government behaves differently. In your observation, what times are we living in?"
Lucas: "Ah..."
Patricia: "It's ok. Nothing you say here will cause you trouble."
Lucas: "Well... From my observations, life in Eurasia has many peculiarities."
Patricia: "..."
Lucas: "In other words... I suspect we're in trouble."
