## Causes of Conspiracies
Often stemmed from a genuine concern, but exaggerated to a point that makes certain people feel like they have to take drastic action outside the existing system. 
## Needs of Conspiracies
##### Division into Cells
Small, compartmentalised units of operation, with tightly segregated information, such that if one is discovered, the rest aren't in danger. 
##### Resources
Drastic actions require mobilisation of large resources. Whether in research, construction, employment and bribes. 
##### Secrecy and Security
Draw minimal attention, while employing security. 
##### Extensive planning to deal with variances in the final plan
When the timing is right, the execution of the plan must be done perfectly. But when things go not exactly as planned, they need contingencies. 
## When Dealing with Intrusive People
Conspiracies when dealing with intrusive people, often go through the following stages commonly ordered as: 
**avoid -> distract -> intimidate -> recruit -> murder**
##### Avoid
Initially, the conspiracy avoids the intruder if they can. They keep their operations hidden from view. 
##### Distract
If the intruder is persistent on investigating the conspiracy, the conspiracy must throw their investigation off track. Red herrings. Fake evidence that point to nowhere. 
##### Intimidate
If the intruder's investigation has progressed to a stage where the heart of the conspiracy is close to being exposed, they will intimidate - taking advantage of their hidden identities, they can threaten the intruder even if the intruder tries to contact the police. 
##### Recruit
If the intruder is very skilled and valuable, the conspiracy may plant a mole near them, and carefully feed them the conspiracy's ideologies. When the time is right, they will try to recruit them. 
##### Murder
This only happens if absolutely necessary. If an intruder progresses to the recruitment stage and refuses, they must be dealt with. If any new intruder happens to find the most threatening things to the conspiracy, they must be dealt with.
