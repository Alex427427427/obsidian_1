## The Fundamental Question
How should information be managed? 
1. Generation - how should it be collected/created? What information should be collected/created? Who gets to create information?
2. Distribution - how should it be distributed? Who should have access to it? what information should be distributed? 
## The Two Sides
##### Free generation and access of information
Pros: 
1. Free generation and free access: The state can't control information - thus it has one less tool to protect its own legitimacy when bad deeds are done. 
2. Free access: In times of crisis, humans can respond on the local, distributed level of individuals. 
3. Free generation: It is fun. People can share small things that bring others joy, like memes and art. 
Cons: 
1. Free generation: Rubbish ideas, like conspiracy theories, falsehood promoted for financial motives, irrational but passionate ideas, spread much easier than complicated truths. Meaningful signal is drowned out by noise of trifle, bullshit matters. 
2. Free access: when young people, whose minds are formative, get exposed to certain ideas, it may ruin the rest of their development. 
##### Controlled generation and access of information 
The pros and cons of the controlled case are the converse of the pros and cons in the free case. 
## Tangential Branching of the theme into other Domains
##### Relationships
When applied to relationships, openness is often valued more than privacy. Sharing information about your true self. Indeed it may be among the top of what makes relationships worthwhile - to have your inner parts be seen, heard, tenderly examined and acknowledged (and maybe even accepted). Some may withhold important aspects of themselves in fear of the other leaving them. Others will teach them that a relationship like that, is not worth being in anyway. Yet others may decide that certain parts of themselves can really be withheld without damaging the overall quality, deepness and enjoyment of the relationship. 
##### Science
The scientific domain is a special environment where nearly all generators and consumers of information have serious, truth seeking intent. This is where the free generation and access of information has little downsides except for if the total amount is too large for anyone to parse. There are rigorous peer reviews that filter rubbish - this information filter is the main element that makes science a relatively functional information processing system.
