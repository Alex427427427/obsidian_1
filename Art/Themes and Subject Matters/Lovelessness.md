## The Picture
Trauma and hurt from past experiences

Long term deprivation of fundamental human need - intimacy

Intense longing exacerbated by comparison and imagination

Low self worth - love is a thing that others do (I don't deserve it)

Low energy to put in the work to escape loneliness

Hopelessness

Inability to be present - to enjoy what they have, to consider for those around them

A pitiful lifestyle. 
## Material
"I'm only fit to scavenge the cultural excrement of humanity - watching other people's happy lives on social media. Love is a thing that others do." 

"Those drowned in sorrow cannot love." "Those who haven't known sorrow, shouldn't love."

Waking up from a dream to a dark lonely room.
