Once a writer was frustrated that his readers would abandon his books half way. 

He eventually realised he needed to sprinkle gold coins in the book. What are gold coins? Any reward for the reader making their way through the book. 
- plot coins - a surprise, a twist, a cliff hanger, an introduction of a new object
- character coins
- any other expected rewards promised by the premise of the story

As a writer, you must deliver periodic hits of pleasure for the reader. Never let a big gap happen between those points.
