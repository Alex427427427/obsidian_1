In Breaking Bad, Mike had to tell Heisenberg not to take half measures. He could have just said it, but instead...

Mike first told a story. When he was a B rate cop, he frequently got calls to this domestic violence case, of a husband beating his wife. Mike stuck a gun up to the husband's throat and warned him that if he does this again, expect to get it. In 2 weeks, the husband killed his wife. Mike chose a half measure when he should have gone the whole way. 

The point is so much more powerful if there is a story behind it.
