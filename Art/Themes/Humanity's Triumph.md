## The Picture
Human progress over the ages. 
Pre-modernity, filled with irrationality, injustice, falsehood, subservience to higher powers, replaced with modernity, defined by science, reason, truth, and humanism. 
Often mentioned with grand yet dispassionate tones. 
A personal favourite. 
## Aspects of the Triumph
Each can form a thematic conflict for a story.
##### Science over Superstition
Superstitious practices such as sacrificial offerings to a god, can provide an intimately relatable storyline that makes the reader root for the enlightened side. 
##### Reason over Passion
The passionate but misguided or deluded, may fail to achieve important goals for themselves. The introduction of reason may be the key to bring them victory. 
##### Truth over Falsehood / Explanation over Mystery
Dispelling falsehood and bringing about enlightenment. 
##### Humanism over Religion
This is more about the discovery of a better purpose - that of the growing and promotion of humanist causes over serving an imaginary higher power. 
##### Unification over Division
A growing consciousness that we all exist as members of humanity, before we are members of a particular tribe or nation. 
##### The Common Man over the Illegitimate Ruler
Revolutions. 
##### Action over Inaction / Change over Stagnation / Hope over Despair
The realisation that a better future is possible, and the decision to take action, instead of assuming things have been and will always be a certain way. 
##### Effectiveness over Ineffectiveness 
Glorious industry fueled by advanced machinery and technology. 
##### True Logic over Sophistry
The down to earth, those that are in touch with reality, reasoning towards clearer and simpler answers that are true, vs those working with abstractions high in the stratosphere, with no intention to illuminate, but habitually obscure with complexity. Think of the sophisticated philosophical argumentations by certain people in the past that have no relevance to anything real today.
