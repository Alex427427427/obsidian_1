## Types of Story Arcs
##### Contemplative
Cerebral investigation of the mystery
##### Thriller
Navigating dangers
## Hooks
The thing that initially sells your story to a reader. That thing which your story premise promises. 
1. What comes to mind when you think of the premise? 
## Characters
##### In a murder story
- victim family
- victim professional contacts
- if elderly, maybe their nurse and doctor
##### Essential Properties of Suspects
- motive / desire
- secret
##### Seeker's Character 
They should face two issues: one acute, one chronic. The acute issue is the mystery at hand. The chronic issue is their personal issue. These two should weave like a double helix, one helping the other to develop. 

Example: 
Once there was a protagonist who was grief stricken and joyless. One day, a murder occurred, and he felt compelled to solve it. This forced him to embrace that which once made him happy. As a result, he changed and recovered a joyful spirit. 

Example milestones:
1. Challenge accepted - seeker commits emotionally to solving the mystery, 1/4 into the manuscript
2. Break the Barrier to Actualisation - after all is lost, seeker needs to make a big leap outside their belief system, 3/4 into the manuscript
3. Final challenge
## Clues
Delivers information to the detective and reader. 
##### How Many to Put
Around 1 clue per major advance in deduction. In total, not that many are needed. The essential ones are: 
1. A clue for the motive
2. A clue that ties the antagonist to the event of mystery
3. A red herring 
4. (optional) a clue that ties the antagonist to an accomplice
5. (optional) a clue that breaks alibi 
6. (optional) clues for each subplot
##### Physical Clues - Tying Person to Location
Examples:
1. someone has a textbook from a university library
2. someone has mosquito bites from a visit to a swamp
3. someone's lipstick found at a bar's bathroom
##### Physical Clues - Tying Event to Time
Example: 
1. Foot prints in the snow - must have happened before last snowfall
##### Physical Clues - Tying Person to Person 
Example: 
1. someone has blood under her fingernails; later see someone else has scratches.
##### Physical Clues - Backstory
Example: 
1. Someone's paintings
2. Someone's diary
##### Emotional / Behavioural Clues
Reveals what someone **knows, feels, believes**. 
Example: 
1. Hesitation to answer a question
2. Inappropriate emotional reaction 
3. averse towards someone else
4. Changing behaviour - after they had some transformational experience
##### Revealing Knowledge
Example:
1. An English person uses French sayings - reveals a history with France
2. Someone knows a detail about a murder undisclosed by the forensics. 
##### Absent Clue
When something that was expected to be found wasn't. 
Example: 
1. Sherlock Holmes - adventure of Silverback, where a horse called Silverback went missing. Sherlock: "I want to know the curious incident of the dog at nighttime." "The dog did nothing during night time." "That was the curious incident."
2. Someone insists they went to the church. When asked how it was, they give vague or wrong answers, clearly not having the knowledge of what happened during it. 
##### Testimony
A way to deliver any of the above clues. 
## Red Herrings
Distractions from the solution to the mystery
## Plot Twist
Something that the reader believes... later turns out to be false. Requires building an assumption and later breaking that assumption - in a way that serves to advance the mystery.
