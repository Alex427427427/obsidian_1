___
## Thesis
Telling: delivering the conclusion
Showing: delivering the evidence 
Showing gives a better reader experience than telling. 
## Pixar Writer TED talk
It is the art of not giving the audience a 4, but 2+2. It is making the audience do work for the story, but not let them realise it. 
## Techniques to Show and not Tell
- Provide evidence
- Replace the abstract with the concrete
## Examples
1. Ted was terrified now. Telling. Ted's heart began racing. Showing. 
2. Susan was heartbroken. Telling. Susan fell to her knees. Showing. 
Note that what is telling in some situation, can be showing in others.
1. X is a dangerous person. Telling. Y is terrified to hear X's name. Showing. 
The key is that for any given conclusion you want to give the reader, take one step back and present everything up to that penultimate step. The reader will naturally take the final step. Let the reader take the final step. 

Of course, in that final example, you can make it doubly showing: Y's heart began racing upon hearing X's name. 
## Misconception
Show don't tell is NOT about:
- being detailed or lengthy in the description
