___
When characters' actions and emotions are not warranted by what has objectively been conveyed by the author about their situation. 
## Causes
##### Stakes
The stakes and conflicts of the story have not been sold to the reader yet. (or the stakes and conflicts were poor choices to begin with, e.g. too convoluted)
**It is vital to sell easily understood stakes and conflict of the story.**
##### Unrealistic human behaviour
E.g. too many physical movements in quick succession during an emotional scene like a man discovering his wife's infidelity. 
E.g. emotional whiplash - quick changes in emotion. The woman going from rolling her eyes to wailing loudly to falling to her knees for forgiveness. 
We don't get big build up to these moments. 

Remedy: understand how humans react emotionally to events. Humans conceal or fight against their own emotions a lot. And genuine emotions do not arise quickly. 
##### Excessive Poeticism
Makes things too lofty and abstract, which becomes strangely detached, losing the relatability and authenticity of the moment. 

Remedy: stay grounded in descriptions of real things, especially in strong emotional situations.
