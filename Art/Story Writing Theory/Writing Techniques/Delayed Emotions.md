When a character goes through something gigantically tragic, like being rejected from all their college applications or the death of a loved one, the first instinct may be to show them react dramatically, like falling to their knees and crying, or going out drinking. 

But here's a way to increase realism and relateability. Delay the emotions. This is true to life and will make the characters seem authentic. 

Later on have something small trigger the break down, like someone cutting in line or they can't open an envelope. 

In Manchester by the sea, a boy is told his father died. He doesn't seem fazed, until much later he struggles to put frozen chicken back into the fridge after falling out, and that's when he loses it.
