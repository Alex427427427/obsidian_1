___
When someone was near the 9-11 incident, their first action was to head to their university gym, and hit bench presses. ....why? 

Maybe it was to feel strong in the face of a tragedy that made him feel weak.
Maybe the gym was always a place of comfort. 
Maybe it was a place to hide from the crazyness outside. 

Funky reactions that go against common sense can be used to introduce an interesting aspect of the character.
