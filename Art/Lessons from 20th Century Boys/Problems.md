Dragged on too long. 

Too many unexplained threads - psychic powers, holy mother, daughter and eternal life

Too many fake out deaths

Mystery clues are shown too much on the fly. 

Some characters were useless - Yukiji, Kanna (later)

Climaxes were overexaggerated, but at the same time underplayed and over too soon. 

Not really shown how the conspiracy grew. 



"I remember someone explaining it better than I can relay: Urasawa tells stories like a grandpa.

He starts out great, and you know it's going to be great cause the man is a legend. Then he kind of wanders off on a tangent. You don't want to interrupt but yeah he's definitely rambling. But when you ask "what happened with the main plot"... He gives you a one liner and "the end".

I'm not saying he didn't write masterpieces but the storytelling definitely could use some polish."
