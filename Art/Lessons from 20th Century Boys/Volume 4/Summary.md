(Outside my descriptions here, there are frequency blashbacks to Otcho's training with the monk.)

We follow Shogun, 2000 Bangkok. 
Works as a fighter(?) to help people(?). Goes to an ovredosiing police officer. 

Japan already belongs to Friend via the Frienship democratic party. 
Shogun recognisees the friendship badge. 

----
**Shogun is probably Otcho**. 

Shogun saves Mei whom he sent home earlier. Bumps into Intermediate antag Manjoume Inshuu, who is now a member of the Japanese cabinet. 

----
Mei thanks Shogun. Shogun sees her walk on the bus to hometown. She asks if she and Shogun are friends. He says yes. 

Mei returns to shop stabbed and mortally wounded. Tells Shogun Inshuu is gonna kill him, followed her bus. She dies. 

Shogun gets a call. It's Kenji. Kenji calls Shogun Otcho. 

----
Otcho remembers childhood. 
Secret base was destroyed by Yambo and Mabo, the evil twins. Kenji was gonna go fight them. Asks for help from Otcho, who declines - the world is about love and peace now. 

Present day Kenji tells Otcho what's happening in Japan. Kenji needs Otcho's strength. Otcho declines. 

In memory, Otcho shows up to Kenji's fight after all - love and peace is on hold. 

In present, Otcho carries Mei's body, saying he has some things to take care of first. 

----
Otcho brings Mei to village. Learns of drug opreation. Goes there. Gets drugged. sees Friend's plan of the giant robot. 

---
Otcho and Friend half leader drink drug. Friend person is losing sanity but Otcho is unfazed. He already had faced his fears in the past. He had already lived th eworst day of his life - his son's death. That's why he doesn't hallucinate. 
He makes Friend person confess their own regrets. 
He brings that person to burn down the Rainbow kid opration. 

When he was thrown into waterfall, and came back up, he realised that he was just in plain reality. (**theme?**)

---
Otcho and exleader of a group in Friend go to the operation and swiftly take it down. ex Friend re-enters the fire to save more people. The place explodes. 

Otcho lands in Japan. 
Sees the streets. A man approaches him saying he's Kenji. 

----
Kenji meets Otcho at son's grave. Kenji explains how he tracked him down with flowres that came from Bangkok. Kenji is now wanted for crimes blamed on him. He wears a dumb rabbit suit. 

Kenji shows Otcho the secret base they have in abandoned subway. Mum is well. Kanna is well, and greets Otcho. 

Kenji has been training physically. He tried to sing about the conspiracy but no one listened. He snuck into the germ manufacturing HQ with the laser gun (actually a stun gun) and stole some flopy disks he can't read due to encryption. 

Otcho shares with Kenji that the giant robot has already been built. 

We jump to the conspiracy. Inshuu is please with the robot. Professor pleads to see his daughter. 

---
Bfore construction of robot, professir sits in room with bunch of cult members discussing plans of the robot. Prof points out how ridiculous the plan is. 

Friend wants it remote controlled and have a cockpit. And be powered with nuclear energy. 

Present day, Kenji visits a brothel to find the daughter. 

----
Kenji rveals his rabbit suit holding a sign for the brothel is him trying to get close to the daughter. But everytime she walks out with a man with long blond hair - the one that pushes Kiriko's lovre off. 

Kenji explains situation, tries to peresuade hre to escape. She doesn't. She does let him know where the robot is. Deep in the earth, in Kasumi Gaseki. 

Kenji and Otcho meet outside, determined to visit, and stay alive. (subverting the idea that Kenji thought dying is cool (it was otcho that taught him the opposite.))

In the brothel, the blond assassin meets daughter. She's in on it and told Kenji exactly whta Friend wanted. 

---
Kenji has become skilled in lockpicking, searching. 
They are underground now. Remembering a scary cave they explored inchildhood, that turned out to be mushroom growers. 

They go to the place shown in photo to Otcho where the robot should be. It's empty. A video recording begins, with Friend telling Kenji and Otcho let's play, and they have to get all 9 together.
