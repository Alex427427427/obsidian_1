Opening police talk. Older one about to retire. Brief scene of him calling his son revealing his family situation. Revisiting the virus / blood draining case. 
As young one is about to brush it off as separate cases (prof disappearance and student death), old one brings up the possibility that something big is happening (germ warfare). He brings up the symbol. It seems to serve as a clue a lot up till now. 
Older one talks about visiting theologist. Who pointed him to a cult whose leader had recently been hurt. He visited it, found out leader knows "Friend". 
There was a certain religious group 17 years ago under which both the recent cult leader and Friend studied under. 
Following this track, the old police found the original school where Friend was; he was classmates with Kenji. This closes the circle to the opening of the story. This was quite intriguing. 
The old police went on, that he spoke to their teacher... 
before getting interrupted by a call. He explains to the young that due to his job, he missed every of his daughter's events, until he missed his own wife's death. Daughter never spoke to him after that. This was quite impactful. A moment of silence was shared between the two policemen. 
"Now is not the time to talk about work anymore." "No. I'm a fool who believed that putting his work above everything else in life was the best way to live. And this fool is now speaking to you with years of experience. This case may grow to something monstrously big. No, it may already have." This is impactful, ties in with lingering regret but also resolve for the case. 
The teacher recalled a spoon bending incident. Old police got a call from his daughter telling him to come. Hearing her daughter speak to him in years, he tears up. The young police asks him to go. But reveals that he is a part of Friend group, and drains the old one's blood as the old one walks towards his grandson's party. What a twist.

Yukiji recalls shoujo manga. And how she felt like Kenji was a prince on a white horse. 
**The time for Human Extinction**

Yukiji tells Kenji she's organising a primary school reunion, to obtain info. Subtle moment saying meting people again just makes her feel disillusionment. 
The man who created the symbol is nowhere to be found. And someone called Friend is using it for an organisation. Otcho, apparently went ot India to become a monk. 
Yukiji asks Kenji why he didn't com to the parent witness meeting. He wants to explain that he has the store and baby to take care of, even quitting the band. She says she shouldn't have returned. She leaves after questioning if that's really why he left the band. 

Friend cult scene giving glimpse of motivation of Friend. Follower asks what the cosmos wants the Friend to do. Not to unify religion. But to achieve his dream. **theme of dreams**. His dream is world conquest. Ominously, narration goes "In December of 2000, humanity will be destroyed."

----
Old homeless man dreams huge calamity. Interacts with Kenji, saying he will suffer great calamity. But hte baby on his back.... They interact joyfully. Gives some sense of hope. 

His prdiction that some kids will hurt his friend came true. Demo of his psychic abilities. 

He dreams of a giant machine in 2000 that will destroy humanity.

Kenji remembrs his sister saving him from drowning, him, who will sav the world later. 

Present day, slice of life. Kenji is scolded. He remembers sister saving him - she was looking in the river for mosquito larvae (....?). Later, we see her study microbiology. 

Kenji flips thru Kiriko (sister)'s letters. One with no sender says "so your plan and my plan were the same. What a wonderful thing, to meet someone with the same plan as you." The letter has the eye symbol on it.

Kenji, remembring momnts from his life with his sister. His yearning to be a musician. His sister protecting him and watching ovr him, taking over th family convnience store. His sister going on a date with a rich boy she hated, to get Kenji his guitar. That moment, Kenji felt invincible. 

**I notice that Kenji's motivation and feelings are fleshed out in a relateable way. There is the recurring theme of lost dream. A speculation of where th story is going. Friend's relentless pursuit of his dreams, juxtaposes Kenji's taking on responsibility. While Friend rmained a boy, Kenji became a man. Friend may have a rant about dreams to Kenji at the climax, but the ending will reveal the virtue of Kenji's life decisions. I tear up; if this doesn't get explored in the story, I could always use it in my own.**

Kenji stands up to the contractor for his shop, vowing to take care of Kanna (th baby) until sister returns. 
Before meeting father of her child, sister's lover jumpd in front of a train. Suspicious. 

----
We follow the man who pushed Kiriko's suitor off the platform. He rizzes up a highschool girl, who is missing professor's daughter. He specialises in robot construction. In 2000, a robot rampages through the city. He gives  intermdiate antag a manual to rizz up women, so that Friend could rizz up Kiriko. 

He is an assassin on hire by the Friend group.
