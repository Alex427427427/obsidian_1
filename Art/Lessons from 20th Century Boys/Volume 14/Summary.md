While Kanna keeps eye on intruder to the simulation, Yukiji and a member track down the virus spreader in japan in China town. 

Yukiji sees someone that couldn't be walking around, and chases and loses him. Otcho is there too. 

Manjoume is right near Yoshi and Kyoko. Suddenly, a fourth person moves through the sim with inhuman speed, must be the creator of the sim?

Kanna enters sim, transported to Kenji room. 
Kanna emotionally hugs KEnji and tells him to live through whatever comes next. 

Donkey looks at the moon - thinking about the flag on the moon, and that someday he will be there too. 
Mankind has gone to the moon with the power of science, so there can't be ghosts. 

Donkey lights up. Sees a boy hanging himself.

Sada and Yamane are there too. Say that a miracle about to happen. Tell Donkey not to help Fukubei. 

Fukubei wakes from the rope. Tells Donkey to tell others about miracle. 

Donkey, with reason, knows it's a trick. Fukubei tells the two to banish him. Donkey jumps out of the window. 

Manjoume shows up. Kanna shows up. Manjoume wants to know there's something more to the truth. A man shadow behind him now.

Manjoume wants to know what happened after. And for Fukubei to stop his lies. 

The man behind says it's the truth. He wraps his head in the same towel that the dead Fukubei was. Is this Fukubei?

Rizzd up girl says to rizzler she saw "him" walking thru streets. 

The man pulls Fukubei kid down and strangles him, saying this is the truth. MAjoume tries to stop. Manjoume wakes up with blood nose. Friend stands before him, having taken off the headset.

Kyoko pulls Sada mask off and wakes up. Yoshi and Kanna are left in sim. Yoshi wakes in a field. 

It was his younger self, trying hard to rebuild the secret base. He helps himself. He wakes up, teary eyed. He finally remembers what he was doing back in 1971. He did well, all by himself. **this is a heart warming moment**.

Kanna runs towards Donkey, looking at pond. Donkey knows the rational truth about the pond which others are spreading rumours about. There is no ghost. He runs off to the mansion. Kanna follows. 

Donkey wonders about the moon. There are no rabbits. Just desert and craters. And human footprints. What is the point of being the bad guy? It's completely unscientific. Last night, he saw the bad guy. He was going to be the bad guy. But, there are no good guys to fight him. 

Kanna asks about Kenji and Otcho. Donkey says they have potential. So does Donkey. Kanna knows Donkey is going to do the right thing. When you die, you don't turn into nothing. You remain in memories. They exchange dreams - Donkey wants to be a science teacher. They tell each other to be good guys. 

Kanna promises Donkey to be a hero. She wakes up.
