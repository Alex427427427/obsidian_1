### Ranking System
S - unskippable. This category contains the best writing/imagery/atmosphere/intrigue and is the soul of Ultraseven. 

A - anyone could watch. These episodes are solid overall, with great aliens and setup. 

B - Alex could watch, but not mandatory for new viewers. These episodes are standard routine alien-of-the-week. 

C - new viewers should skip. These episodes are boring, and production is too jarring.

Anne's uncle lore
I like how the aliens recognise Seven as an alien and ask him not to interfere, like diplomacy.
Uchujins hurting each other is senseless. We warn you, Seven. 
I like how much order and civilisation there is in the universe. That earth is caught in the middle of these giant bodies.
