### Reasons to apply, how I will benefit
Reasons to apply:
1. I love optics, it has my favourite stuff in this degree by far. Wave optics, E&M, Quantum optics, Fourier optics, all the maths associated... I love all of it. For my experimental unit I chose all optics related experiments and I loved all of them. It's the topic I find myself coming back to in my personal time again and again. 
2. I want a career in research, or at the very least do a PhD. I see this as a natural stepping stone towards those goals. I had done a robotics summer research project before, and I quite enjoyed the research process. 
3. I think I have the skills and aptitude for these projects. I have a solid mathematical and theoretical foundation, and nowadays it allows me to pick up a new topic with ease; I have good hands-on skills developed throughout my engineering degree; I have good computational skills proven in my internship, should such skills be required. I am a good communicator and am pleasant to be around. 

How I will benefit:
1. Have 4 weeks of valuable experience in an optics laboratory setting
2. Gain insight into what research is like in this particular field
