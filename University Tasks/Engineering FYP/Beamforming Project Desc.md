## Description
The project involves the array analysis, synthesis and design of smart array antenna at **L-, Ku- and Ka-bands in a shared aperture** configuration. Advanced theoretical and practical implementation knowledge of **CMOS technology/MEMS for phase shifters**, beamforming networks, **beam switching electronics** and **high power and low noise amplifiers** are essential to design and develop the physical layer of the antenna. The development of smart antenna needs **advanced signal processing algorithms** and implementation **in FPGAs and micro-controllers**. Sound knowledge in soil moisture radiometer theory is an added advantage. High-quality analytical and hands-on skills in antenna theory, beamforming network design, CMOS/MEMS technologies, a commitment to experimental research, and the development of theoretical concepts are essential. The project can recruit up to 2 FYP students starting in February 2022.
