# 1 Aim
Trap polystyrene spheres with a range of sizes using an optical tweezer apparatus, and measure the effective spring constant of the optical trap potential, as a function of laser power and depth of the trap in the sample. 
# 2 Background and Theory
In 1980, Ashkin et al. [1] discovered a method of all-optical trapping of particles in the micrometer regime that results from momentum transfer from the light beam to the particle, and with clever shaping of the beam, creating a potential well in the transverse and longitudinal directions that attract small particles and trap them there. This is the optical tweezer. 

Since then, optical tweezing has been applied to trap atoms, molecules, and microorganisms [2]. For those objects that cannot be tweezed directly, chemically bonding them to microspheres that could be tweezed, opened up immense potential in the chemical and biological sciences [3]. 

This experiment seeks to trap polystyrene spheres with an optical tweezer and measure the trapping strength by utilising statistical mechanics. Trapping strength as a function of laser power and depth of the trap in the sample will be produced. 
### 2.1 Optical Tweezing
Light carries momentum in the direction of propagation [4]. When light interacts with an object and exits the interaction with a changed direction, the momentum of the outgoing ray is different from the incident ray. The difference in this momentum $\Delta p$ was transferred to the object. 

Consider a single thick beam of light incident on a lens-like object. Most of the light is refracted and exits the object with symmetry about the optical axis, as shown in Figure 2.1.1 a). If the beam was instead concentrated near the optical axis, such as a Gaussian beam profile, then something interesting happens. When the object is displaced in any transverse direction, the high intensity rays will deflect in the same direction as the object's displacement, thus imparting momentum in the opposing direction to the object's transverse displacement. This is illustrated in figure 2.1.1 b) c) d). Thus the object is trapped in the transverse direction about the center of the beam. 
![[Pasted image 20241020174934.png]]
*Figure 2.1.1 - Transverse Restoring Mechanism. a) Particle centered at uniform beam. b) Particle centered at beam with high intensity at the center. c) Particle displaced upward in the beam. d) Particle displaced downward in the beam.*

Now consider the same beam focused by a lens such that the incident rays have a wide angular distribution. Suppose the object is displaced longitudinally away from the focus of the beam, in the direction of beam propagation. Figure 2.1.2 a) demonstrates that the refraction results in the beam having a more forward pointing momentum, thus a backward momentum is imparted to the object. Suppose the object is displace longitudinally against the direction of beam propagation. Figure 2.1.2 b) demonstrates that the beam becomes more wide spread after exiting the object, meaning the beam lost forward momentum, which means a forward momentum was imparted to the object. This is the mechanism of trapping in the longitudinal direction. Thus the object is trapped about the focus of the beam. An alternative way to think about this is that the focus of the beam created a longitudinal intensity variation similar to the transverse intensity variation that allowed for the trapping in the transverse direction. 
![[Pasted image 20241020174943.png]]
*Figure 2.1.2 - Longitudinal Restoring Mechanism. a) Particle displaced rightward  from the center of the trap. b) Particle displaced leftward from the center of the trap.*

For effective optical trapping, the object ought to have low reflectivity and higher refractive index than its surroundings, since the trapping mechanism relies primarily on refracted rays. 

From the above discussion, it is clear that a laser light (often engineered to have a Gaussian transverse intensity profile), focused by a lens at large angles, is perfect for optical tweezing. The focus of the beam is the center of the trap. 
### 2.2 Using Brownian Motion to find the Frequency Response of the Optical Tweezer Potential
The potential of the optical trap has a region about the center of the trap that can be approximated by a second order potential as shown in Figure 2.2.1. With such a potential, the system dynamics of the sphere in the optical trap follows a second order frequency response like a spring-mass system or an LC resonator. If the frequency response could be obtained somehow, then the corner frequency could be determined and the effective spring constant be found. 
![[Pasted image 20241020185449.png]]
*Figure 2.2.1 - Comparison between a harmonic potential and a typical optical tweezers potential [5]*

Microscopic objects suspended in liquid undergo Brownian motion due to collision with the particles in the fluid. This can be taken advantage of to measure the effective spring constant of the system. 

The differential kicks of Brownian motion follows a white noise i.e. uniform power spectrum [6]. Since this is the input to the system, the output of the system (displacement of the trapped sphere) will have a power spectrum equal to the transfer function of the system. In other words, by using Brownian motion to supply energy into the system equally at all frequencies, the measured displacement of the object will directly produce the transfer function in the frequency domain. This results in a Lorentzian distribution shown in Figure 2.2.2. 

![[Pasted image 20241020191450.png]]
*Figure 2.2.2 - Lorentzian distribution in the log-log scale and the linear scale. $\gamma$ is frequency, $\gamma_0$ is the corner frequency.*

The power spectrum $S$ as a function of frequency $f$ is: 
$$S(f) = \rho^2\frac{k_B T}{\pi^2\beta (f_0^2 + f^2)}\ \ \ \\ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1)$$
where $\rho$ is the linear voltage-to-displacement calibration factor, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, $\beta=6\pi\eta r$ is the Stokes drag of the sphere where $r$ is the radius of the sphere and $\eta$ is the viscosity of the liquid which is the same as distilled water in this experiment, $f_0$ is the corner frequency [5]. 

The effective spring constant can be recovered from the corner frequency formula for second order systems:
$$f_0=\frac{1}{2\pi LC}$$
where $L=\beta$ is the inertial element and $C=1/k$ is the compliant element, and $k$ is the effective spring constant of the optical tweezer trap. Rearranging for $k$ yields:
$$k=2\pi f_0\beta=12\pi^2\eta r f_0 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (2)$$
### 2.3 Theoretical Prediction of Spring Constant
A theoretical approximate expression for the spring constant in the transverse plane is given by the following distressing equation: 
$$k=\alpha I_0\omega\frac{2\pi\epsilon^3}{c\xi^3}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\left(\left(\frac{\xi a}{\epsilon}\right)^2-1\right)\exp\left[-\frac{a^2}{2}\right]erf\left[\frac{\xi a}{\sqrt2 \epsilon}\right]+\frac{\xi a}{\epsilon}\exp\left[-\frac{a^2}{2\epsilon^2}\right]\right)$$
where $\alpha=(\frac{n_p^2}{n_0^2}-1)$, $n_p=1.58$ is the refractive index of polystyrene, $n_0=1.33$ is the refractive index of water, $a=r/w$, $r$ is the radius of the sphere, $\omega$ is the size of the laser focus spot, $\xi=\sqrt{1-\epsilon^2}$ where $\epsilon=3$ is the eccentricity parameter of the optical trap used in this experiment as the ratio of its longitudinal and transverse waist sizes, and $I_0$ is the peak intensity of the focused beam and can be calculated by the power of the beam $P$ using $I_0=\frac{2P}{\pi\omega^2}$. The beam size produced in this experiment is $\omega=(4.41\pm0.1)\times 10^{-7}$m [5]. 
### 2.4 Preparatory Questions
##### 2.4.1 Question 1: Reasons for using Blue Light to Illuminate the Trapped Microspheres
Blue light is far away from the red laser on the visible wavelength spectrum. The benefits are two fold. 

Firstly, the blue light can be easily selectively let through the various dielectric mirrors required to divert the laser beams, while still allowing the blue light to coincide with the red laser in the region of the sample, for imaging. 

Secondly, the blue light will not interfere with the trapping strength which occurs in the red laser regime. 
##### 2.4.2 Question 2: Purpose of the Oil under the Microscope Objective
The oil is used to match the refractive index in the region between the objective and the sample, to the sample. If this was not matched, refraction of light would result in decreased image quality. 
# 3 Experimental Logs

### 3.1 Acquaintance with the Setup
The optical tweezer apparatus is shown in the Figure 3.1.1 schematic. 
![[Pasted image 20241020195840.png|400]]
*Figure 3.1.1 - Schematic of the optical tweezer set up [5].*

The apparatus can be best understood in three parts:
- Firstly, the trapping site, shown on the right of Figure 3.1.1. It consists of a microscope slide that contains the microspheres suspended in fluid, placed directly under the microscope objective lens. The slide lays on a platform that has precise 3D position setting by 3 knobs that advance in units of thou. 
- Secondly, the trapping beam, traced out by red strips on Figure 3.1.1. It begins at the red diode laser, passing through a collimating lens and then a series of mirrors and lenses, until a sharply focusing lens that focuses the beam at the sample volume. The beam passes through the sample, then a lens and a series of mirrors, to reach a high selectivity filter and landing on a photodiode module that has 4 pixels. This trapping beam's purpose is two-fold. Firstly, it performs the trapping at the trapping site. Secondly, it provides fine measurements on the object's transverse position, changing how light lands on the quadrant photodiode. The photodiode can obtain data at the very high frequencies required to capture the object's constrained Brownian motion. 
- Finally, the imaging path, traced out by blue strips on Figure 3.1.1. It begins at a blue LED that is the source of the blue light. The light passes through a collimating lens, passing through a series of mirrors and lenses to focus at the trapping site, then passes through the microscope objective and eventually reaching a CCD camera. This part of the apparatus provides visual data on the sample through a computer screen. 

I arrived at the lab and inspected the apparatus, matching my understanding of the schematic with the physical setup shown in Figure 3.1.2. 
![[Pasted image 20241020201729.png|400]]
*Figure 3.1.2 - Physical set up of the optical tweezer apparatus.*

There are a few items not mentioned above. 

There are adjustment screws for the M6 mirror as shown in Figure 3.1.3 that centers the laser beam on the quadrant photodiode. 
![[Pasted image 20241020202334.png|400]]
*Figure 3.1.3 - M6 adjustment.*

There is a control knob for the blue LED's laser, which, upon the CCD camera's exposure auto-adjustment, allows the red laser dot to become visible or invisible on the computer screen. There is also a control panel that adjusts the current draw of the laser, hence its power. 
![[Pasted image 20241020202007.png|400]]
*Figure 3.1.3 - Left: Blue LED brightness control; right: red laser power control.*

There are bottles containing samples of microspheres suspended in water. They appear to be clear. 
### 3.2 Practicing the Procedure
##### 3.2.1 Sample Preparation
- I shook the sample containers well so that the microspheres diffused throughout the solution. 
![[Pasted image 20241020202643.png|400]]
*Figure 3.2.1.1 - microsphere solution, stirred.*

- I put a new pipette tip on the micropipette unit, immersed in the solution, drew 4$\mu L$, wiping excess liquid on the side of the container, and dispensed the microsphere as a drop on a microscope slide. 
![[Pasted image 20241020202750.png|400]]
*Figure 3.2.1.2 - drop of microsphere solution on microscope slide.*

- I placed a thin coverslip over the droplet and observed the droplet flatten and spread to the sides of the slip, taking care not to drop the box of coverslips or cut myself with them. 
- I sealed the sides of the coverslip by painting them over with nail polish, preventing the microsphere solution to evaporate through the sides, causing currents in the liquid that would later interfere with trapping. 
![[Pasted image 20241020202846.png|400]]
*Figure 3.2.1.3 - microsphere solution sealed below coverslip and nail polish.*

- I put a drop of index matching oil on top of the coverslip, for the objective lens to immerse in so that the laser angle distribution was the correct shape for trapping to be possible. 
##### 3.2.2 Loading the sample into the apparatus
- I made sure the objective lens was rotated away from the sample tray. 
- I placed the microscope slide containing the microsphere sample onto the sample tray and fixed it in place with the arms of the sample tray. 
- I rotated the objective lens back until it was in line with the beam, taking care that the lens would not touch any wet nail polish. 
![[Pasted image 20241020202946.png|400]]
*Figure 3.2.2.1 - sample slip loaded.*

- I turned on the blue LED to maximum brightness to illuminate the sample. 
- I opened the ThorCam software. 
- I adjusted the vertical position of the sample trap slowly until the microspheres appeared on screen. They were blurry at first but at certain heights they came into focus. When not in focus, they showed up as circular fraunhofer patterns. 
![[Pasted image 20241020203033.png|400]]
*Figure 3.2.2.2 - microspheres on screen.*

- Some of the microspheres were jiggling in brownian motion. 
- Very occasionally, I observed some small debris in the solution. 
##### 3.2.3 Trapping the spheres
- Before trapping, I had to make sure that the laser beam was centered to the sample. To check this, I turned off the blue LED, adjusted the vertical position of the sample tray until I observed a fraunhofer pattern for the laser. Since the pattern was symmetric as shown in Figure 3.2.3.2, I knew that the laser was incident on the sample with almost no offset angle. 
![[Pasted image 20241020203245.png|400]]
*Figure 3.2.3.1 - Laser on.*

![[Pasted image 20241020203322.png|400]]
*Figure 3.2.3.2 - Sample not at laser focus plane. Fraunhofer pattern observed.*

- I turned the blue LED back on, and adjusted the vertical position of the sample tray until the unmoving spheres were in focus - they were on the bottom of the sample volume. The laser was focused into a dot. 
- I moved the tray horizontally until the laser moved over the sphere, immediately trapping it. The sphere was dragged around by the laser on the floor of the sample volume. 
![[Pasted image 20241020203423.png]]
*Figure 3.2.3.3 - laser focus on microsphere. Transversely, the microsphere was confined.*

- I tried to slowly lower the sample tray so that the sphere would be suspended in the middle of the solution by the laser, but this didn't work. The sphere was too attracted to the floor. 
- I moved around horizontally in search for other spheres, and noticed that most spheres were unmoving, stuck to the floor. The floor may had been unclean (I remembered that i left a finger print on it before cleaning it with wipes), causing charge displacement and electrostatic attraction of the spheres. 
- I prepared a new sample with a clean microscope slide and repeated the thus far described procedure. This time, I was able to trap the sphere with the laser. 
- I confirmed that the sphere was trapped by moving the tray vertically and observing that the trapped sphere was still in focus, unlike the rest of the spheres. 
- I also confirmed by sliding the L2 lens, which resulted in the laser trap moving vertically, and observing that the sphere moved in and out of focus while the tray was stationary. 
##### 3.2.4 Observing the frequency spectrum of motion in the potential of the tweezer
- Near the center of the trap, the sphere was in a harmonic potential. Due to the disturbance of particles, the sphere would be driven to move about in this potential. The potential had a specific frequency response that, when observed, would quantitatively verify that the sphere was trapped. The frequency response would be a typical second order response like in an LC circuit. 
- I opened the software that processed the information of the quad-photodiode sensor, producing the position in $x$ and $y$ directions (transverse to the laser beam, in plane of the sample tray), at a rate of 10kHz, and collecting 10k samples, and the gain plot of those signals over frequencies. 
- I observed a shape of the frequency response and saw the bend characteristic to a second order response. However, the low frequency was not flat. This was due to the x and y position not being centered. 
![[Pasted image 20241020203627.png|500]]
*Figure 3.2.4.1 - Power spectrum of uncentered beam*

- I adjusted the M6 mirror until the x and y signals were approximately around 0. 
![[Pasted image 20241020203657.png|500]]
*Figure 3.2.4.2 - Power spectrum of centered beam*

- Due to the sensitivity of the tweezer, the tiny vibrations caused by me adjusting the M6 mirror resulted in the sphere falling out of the tweezer. This was actually noticeable on the plots - the frequency response became a straight line. 
- I tweezed another sphere and repeated the M6 alignment. 
- The new frequency plot was much closer to the expected response. 
- I changed the number of samples to 100k, and observed an improvement in the quality of the frequency response.
![[Pasted image 20241020203802.png|500]]
*Figure 3.2.4.3 - power spectrum of centered beam, at long sample time*
### 3.3 Experiment 1: Measuring the trap spring constant
- I took a lunch break, and when I returned, all the spheres in the liquid were stuck to the floor. 
- I took a temperature measurement of the room, which was 22 degrees celsius.
- I prepared a new sample, of roughly 10 thou deep (34 lowest - 25 highest), and tweezed a sphere, aligned M6 mirror, set the sample rate to 10kHz, and taking 100k samples. 
- I varied the laser power from 60mA to 110mA in increments of 5mA. For each laser power, I took a snap shot of the frequency response. I wrote the files and exported for later analysis. When the power was reduced to 61mA (the minimum), the sphere fell out due to the weakness of the trap. 
- I repeated this for the 1.24um spheres, with a roughly 10thou deep sample (28 - 18), and tweezed a sphere, aligned M6 mirror, and collected the same data as before. The temperature was 22.4 degrees Celsius. 
- The 1.24um sphere was lost half way through the measurement, so I had to restart. I noticed that the 1.24um sample was dense, and very easy for a second or even third sphere to wander into the trap.
- I prepared a new sample. 1.24um, around 13 thou deep (30 bottom, 17 top). 22.5 degrees. I obtained the frequency response for every 5mA between 65 to 110mA.
### 3.4 Experiment 2: Measuring the transverse spring constant at different depths
- With the 1.24um sample still loaded (13 thou deep, 28 bottom 15 top, 22.5 degrees), I turned the laser power to 110mA. 
- For every thou, I turned the vertical knob, adjusted the M6 mirror so the light from the sphere was centered on the 4-pixel photodiode, and saved the frequency responses. 
# 4 Analysis and Discussion
### 4.1 Determining the Trap Spring Constant
I imported the files into a python script, calculated the radial motion by $r=\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, and fit the Lorentz distribution to them. An example fit is shown in Figure 4.1.1. 
![[Pasted image 20241020214821.png|400]]
*Figure 4.1.1 - example fit of the Lorentzian distribution to the power spectral density*

- The fit produced corner frequency values and their uncertainties. For now, I record the values for all of x, y and r. 
- A troubling thing occurred when I noticed that the fits for y and r are often poor quality, because there is a spike at around 100Hz that tricks the fitting algorithm into thinking the corner frequency is there. The problem is less pronounced for the x graphs. This is demonstrated in the following figures. 
![[Pasted image 20241020222636.png|400]]
*Figure 4.1.2 - x power spectral density (PSD)*

![[Pasted image 20241020222252.png|400]]
*Figure 4.1.3 - y PSD.*

![[Pasted image 20241020222307.png|400]]
*Figure 4.1.4 - r PSD*

After all corner frequencies and their uncertainties were obtained, I plotted them. I plotted the frequencies obtained from the x, y, and r PSD, for the 1.54 um beads and 1.24 um beads. The results are shown in Figure 4.1.5 and Figure 4.1.6. 
![[Pasted image 20241020223109.png|500]]
*Figure 4.1.5 - Corner Frequency vs Current for 1.54 $\mu$m bead*

![[Pasted image 20241020223146.png|500]]
*Figure 4.1.6 - Corner Frequency vs Current for 1.24 $\mu$m bead

It's clear that the x data is the best because it actually resembles a linear relationship, while the y and r data are severely contaminated by the sharp spike, that prevented the fitting algorithm to find the actual corner frequency as it did with x. 

Using Equation 2, and the viscosity of distilled water of , I converted the corner frequencies into spring constants. Uncertainties are propagated using the chain rule. The spring constants are shown in Figure 4.1.7. 
![[Pasted image 20241020224720.png]]
*Figure 4.1.7 - Spring constant vs laser current.*

The variation in x matched my expectation, but the variation in y did not. I expected the spring constant to be proportional to the laser power, because laser power is proportional to the momentum, and hence the restoring force imparted on the beads. The flatness of y however, can be understood where the fitting algorithm failed - that it got caught by the sharp peaks in the PSD graphs. 
### 4.2 Determining the Trap Strength
I fit a straight line through the spring constants in the x and y directions for the 1.54 um bead and 1.24 um bead. The results are shown in Figure 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, 4.2.4. 

For the x direction trapping strength of 1.54 um beads, the trapping strength $s$ was found to be $(9.70\pm0.11)\times 10^{-7}$ N/m/mA. 
![[Pasted image 20241020225345.png]]
*Figure 4.2.1 - 1.54 bead, x direction trapping strength fit*
The $R^2$ is negative, meaning numerical failure had occurred in the fitting algorithm. However, the linear fit appears of sufficient quality. The pull plot places a few data points near 5 standard deviations away from the fit. The $\chi^2$ per DOF is 15, meaning the uncertainties are underestimated and the fitting was of poor quality. 

For the y direction trapping strength of 1.54 um beads, the trapping strength $s$ was found to be $(3.5\pm0.4)\times 10^{-7}$ N/m/mA. The $R^2$ is negative, meaning numerical failure had occurred in the fitting algorithm. However, the linear fit appears of sufficient quality. The pull plot places all data points within 1 standard deviation away from the fit. The $\chi^2$ per DOF is 0.41, meaning the uncertainties are overestimated. 

![[Pasted image 20241020233732.png]]
*Figure 4.2.2 - 1.54 bead, y direction trapping strength fit*

For the x direction trapping strength of 1.24 um beads, the trapping strength $s$ was found to be $(6.9\pm5)\times 10^{-7}$ N/m/mA. The $R^2$ is negative, meaning numerical failure had occurred in the fitting algorithm. However, the linear fit appears of sufficient quality. The pull plot places some data points more than 10 standard deviation away from the fit. The $\chi^2$ per DOF is 62, meaning the uncertainties are underestimated and of poor quality. 
![[Pasted image 20241020234008.png]]
*Figure 4.2.3 - 1.24 bead, x direction trapping strength fit*

This one is particularly poor. For the y direction trapping strength of 1.24 um beads, the trapping strength $s$ was found to be $(4.7\pm0.9)\times 10^{-7}$ N/m/mA. The $R^2$ is negative, meaning numerical failure had occurred in the fitting algorithm. The linear fit cannot explain the data at all. The pull plot places some data points more than 10 standard deviation away from the fit. The $\chi^2$ per DOF is 102, meaning the uncertainties are underestimated and of poor quality. 
![[Pasted image 20241020234207.png]]
*Figure 4.2.3 - 1.24 bead, y direction trapping strength fit*

The trapping force is stronger in the direction than in the y direction. This suggests that the beam focus is higher in the x dimension than y. The potential is more steep, resulting in a stronger restoring force. 

The 
### 4.3 Transverse Spring Constant at Different Depths
The fitting algorithm was applied to the PSD obtained in Section 3.4. The corner frequencies were then converted to spring constant using Equation 2. The resulting data is plotted over the height of the bead in the liquid sample. 
![[Pasted image 20241020232804.png|500]]
*Figure 4.3 - Spring constant vs height for the 1.24 um bead, at 110mA*

- From this, I can see no clear pattern for the variation of spring constant as a function of depth in the sample. However, I expected that the spring constant would be stronger in the middle of the sample compared to the top and bottom, due to liquid being harder to move near faces, a simple fact from fluid mechanics. 
- In my expectation, an optimal trapping depth would be in the middle of the sample, where surface drag effects are minimal. Unfortunately, the data doesn't support that. It's possible that the effect would be more pronounced for larger beads. 
# 5 Conclusion
Polystyrene spheres of micrometer scale sizes were successfully trapped with a diode laser in 3 dimensions. The spring constant was determined by the corner frequency of the power spectral density in the x and y directions for the 1.54 micrometer and 1.24 micrometer spheres. The spring constant changes against the trapping depth was also measured but no significant variation was found, contrary to expectations.
