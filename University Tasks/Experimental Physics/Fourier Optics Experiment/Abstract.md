Monochromatic light propagation from an object into the far field results in a wave pattern that is the Fourier Transform of its appearance, an effect emulated by a lens placed one focal length away. The verification of this principle and applications to spatial filtering were investigated. A monochromatic laser was made to shine through various grid patterns, with a lens placed at one focal length further from the pattern, and various spatial filtering apertures placed one focal length further still, all centered at the optical axis. A far field propagation followed, to form the filtered images at a camera. It was found that features along any axis would become smeared along that axis, if a slit aperture blocked the spatial frequencies across that axis at the Fourier plane; if a circular aperture blocked the spatial frequencies in the radial direction, the image became progressively blurred, until it became a gaussian distribution, when only the central spot of the Fourier Transform was preserved; these results were all computationally verified using Fast Fourier Transforms. The filtering results conformed to the predictions of Fourier optics. Applications to hardware devices were discussed.
