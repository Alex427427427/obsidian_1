# 2 Log of the Experiment
### 2.1 Setup
- Arrived at the lab. 
- Read through risk assessment and the apparatus. 
- Took an initial reading of a dosimeter before attaching it to my clothing. 
- Checked electronics are set up correctly.
- Started ADMCA
- Started Compton app to control the stepper motors. Could not connect to the stepper motor. Checked the connection of the stepper motor system. Realised the power was not turned on. Turned on the power, and the Compton app successfully connected to the stepper motors. 
- Calibrated the position of the turntable to 0 degrees. 
- Turned on the MCA for a few seconds, observed a distribution of counts. 
- Opened the shutter to the chamber containing Cs-137 atoms, and turned on the MCA. The distribution grew much faster than before, which is to be expected for an exposed Cs137 source. 
### 2.2 Count Calibration
- Obtained...
- I turned off... 
- I took the dosimeter off my clothing, and recorded the radiation level. There was no noticeable change compared to the start of the lab. 
- 2 days later, I arrived at the lab. 
- I opened the count graphs in the ADMCA software one by one, and selected the regions of interest, and obtained the information relevant to the peaks. 
- To verify that the software gave the correct results, I exported the .mca files and performed a fit in python, with a gaussian model on top of a linear background. The uncertainties were chosen to be $\sqrt{counts}$, due to the process being Poisson.

- The fit had a reduced $\chi^2$ of 1.23 and $R^2$ of 0.99, indicating a very good fit with appropriately determined uncertainties. The results were: 
	- Peak position: 825
	- Net area (of the gaussian): 19867
	- Full Width at Half Maximum: 60.84
	- Net count rate: 323
- Compared to the software results, 
- I collected the peak properties by 
- I plotted the count rates against the thickness of copper, which appears to be an exponential decay.

- I plotted the measured centroid positions against the thickness of copper.

- The graph appears to have a steep decline for low attenuation, and a very slow decline for high attenuation. 
- The elbow of the curve is situated at the data point associated with 4 copper slabs. (The first data point is 0 slabs) But the first point where the curve enters the plateau region is at 6 slabs. This corresponds to **a count rate of 2428**. This ought to be the maximum count rate of the experiment, so that the measured energies do not become too inaccurate. 
### 2.3 Energy Calibration 
- I placed the weaker radioactive samples on the detector arm, propped up by copper plates to place it in line of sight of the detector tube. 
- I rotated the turntable to 45 degrees so that the Cs137 sample leakage radiation would not contaminate the measurements. 
- I started data acquisition. For the Am, Ba and Cs samples, the counts quickly grew. For the Na sample, the counts grew slowly and the features looked very jagged, so I waited for minutes instead of one minute. 
- I plotted the photon energy vs channel number, and FWHM vs channel number. Both resemble a positive linear relationship.

- I entered those results into the calibration of the ADMCA software. 
- I returned the turntable to 0 degrees, removed the copper plates and the weaker radioactive sources, opened the Cs137 shutter and recorded the radiation spectrum, making sure that the count rate was below the threshold where inaccuracies grow too large, by placing 6 copper plates in front of the detector. 
- I recorded the calibrated spectrum of the Cs137.

- There are... 
### 2.4 Variation of Scattering Angle
- I removed the copper slabs, inserted a 21mm collimator into the PMT tube, and a brass rod in line of the Cs137 radiation beam. I set the turn table to 30 degrees. 
- I recorded the spectrum. Since the total photon rate was around 135, far below the threshold of inaccuracy, I noted to myself not to insert any copper plates to attenuate the radiation. 

- I waited until the peak reached 200 counts so that the percentage uncertainty was about 7 percent. I intended to do this for all other measurements.
