# Aim
Quantitatively measure the angular dependence of the scattered photon wavelength in Compton scattering using gamma radiation, and become acquainted with gamma ray spectroscopy. 
# 1 Background Theory
The Compton scattering experiment demonstrates the particle nature of light via scattering of light on free electrons. 
### 1.1 Thomson Scattering
Before Compton scattering was discovered, J. J. Thomson developed a theory of the scattering of light using classical electrodynamics called Thomson scattering [1]. In this picture, incident monochromatic light drives the free charge to oscillate at the same frequency. The acceleration of the charge during this induced oscillation results in the radiation of spherical electromagnetic waves with the same frequency - hence wavelength - as the incident light. 
### 1.2 Compton Scattering
In 1923, Arthur Holly Compton performed X-ray scattering on light elements [1]. He discovered a relationship between the peak wavelength of the scattered X-rays and the scattering angles that was unexplainable using classical electrodynamics. The peak wavelength was discovered to shift to longer wavelengths. Thomson scattering theory predicted unchanging wavelengths so a new explanation was required. 
### 1.3 Photon hypothesis and Compton's Explanation
By then, Albert Einstein had already posited the existence of light quanta called photons [2], which for each frequency $\nu$ assigns identical units of light particles with energy: 
$$E=h\nu=\frac{hc}{\lambda}.\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1)$$
and momentum:
$$p=\frac{E}{c}=\frac{h}{\lambda}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (2)$$
Using this idea, the scattering event can be viewed not as driven oscillations, but collision instead - a collision that transferred energy and momentum to the electron, leaving less energy in the scattered photon, thus a longer wavelength. 
![[Pasted image 20240921222114.png|400]]
*Figure 1 - Rest frame of the unscattered electron $e^-$. A photon $\gamma$ collides with the electron, and is deflected by angle $\theta$ relative to the incident photon direction of travel to become $\gamma^\prime$. The electron recoils with angle $\phi$ relative to the incident photon direction of travel. [3]*

Mathematically, a precise relationship of the wavelength shift and the scattering angle can be obtained using the photon energy equation, the Einstein energy-momentum relation, and energy-momentum conservation of the collision. First consider the momentum vector conservation in the parallel and perpendicular directions:
$$p=p^\prime\cos(\theta)+p_e\cos(\phi)$$
$$p^\prime\sin(\theta)=p_e\sin(\phi)$$
where $p$ is the momentum of the incident photon and $p^\prime$ is the momentum of the scattered photon. Rearranging and squaring the above equations appropriately results in a $\sin^2(\phi)$ and $\cos^2(\phi)$ term that can be added to $1$. 
$$(p-p^\prime\cos(\theta))^2+(p^\prime\sin(\theta))^2=p_e^2$$
$$p^2-2pp^\prime\cos(\theta)+p^{\prime2}\cos^2(\theta)+p^{\prime2}\sin^2(\theta)=p_e^2$$
$$p^2-2pp^\prime\cos(\theta)+p^{\prime2}=p_e^2\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (3)$$
Next, consider the energy conservation:
$$E+m_ec^2=E^\prime+E_e$$
where $m_e$ is the mass of the electron, $E$ is the energy of the incident photon, $E^\prime$ is the energy of the scattered photon, and $E_e$ is the energy of the recoiled electron. Substituting the Einstein energy-momentum relation: 
$$E_e^2=(p_ec)^2+(m_ec^2)^2$$
into the electron energy in the energy conservation equation yields:
$$pc+m_ec^2=p^\prime c+\sqrt{p_e^2c^2+m_e^2c^4}$$
which rearranges to:
$$c(p-p^\prime)+m_ec^2=\sqrt{p_e^2c^2+m_e^2c^4}$$
$$c^2(p-p^\prime)^2+2m_ec^3(p-p^\prime)+m_e^2c^4=p_e^2c^2+m_e^2c^4$$
$$p^2-2pp^\prime+p^{\prime 2}+2m_ec(p-p^\prime)=p_e^2\ \ \ \ \ \ \\ \ \ \ \ \ \ (4)$$
Equating the left hand side of Equation (2) and Equation (3) yields:
$$p^2-2pp^\prime\cos(\theta)+p^{\prime 2}=p^2-2pp^\prime+p^{\prime 2}+2m_ec(p-p^\prime)$$
$$-pp^\prime\cos(\theta)=-pp^\prime+m_ec(p-p^\prime)$$
Substituting Equation (2) gives:
$$-\frac{h^2}{\lambda\lambda^\prime}\cos(\theta)=-\frac{h^2}{\lambda\lambda^\prime}+m_ec(\frac{h}{\lambda}-\frac{h}{\lambda^\prime})$$
$$-\cos(\theta)=-1+\frac{m_ec}{h}(\lambda^\prime-\lambda)$$
$$\boxed{\lambda^\prime-\lambda=\frac{h}{m_ec}(1-\cos(\theta))}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (5)$$
Which is the wavelength shift equation for Compton scattering. The term $h/m_ec$ is the Compton wavelength $\lambda_c$, the wavelength shift of the photon if it was scattered forwardly by the electron. 

Substituting Equation (5) with Equation (1) gives the energy shift equation:
$$\frac{hc}{E^\prime}=\frac{h}{m_ec}(1-\cos(\theta))+\frac{hc}{E}$$
$$\frac{1}{E^\prime}=\frac{1}{m_ec^2}(1-\cos(\theta))+\frac{1}{E}$$
$$E^\prime=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{m_ec^2}(1-\cos(\theta))+\frac{1}{E}}$$
$$\boxed{E^\prime=\frac{E}{1+\frac{E}{m_ec^2}(1-\cos(\theta))}}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (6)\ [3]$$
The following experiment will aim to quantitatively measure the Compton shift equations. 
# 2 Log of the Experiment
### 2.1 Setup
- Arrived at the lab. 
- Read through risk assessment. Took note to never open the windows at the top of the apparatus unless the radioactive source was turned off. Made sure to wear a dosimeter. Took note to stand behind the lead shielding at all times. 
- Examined the apparatus. A radioactive Caesium-137 (Cs137) source was placed inside a shielded chamber, with shutter that could be opened and closed with a hatch. There was a large warning light that lit on whenever the shutter was open. There was a vertical transparent tube that could hold a rod that was the scattering material. To the right, there was a photomultiplier tube (PMT) that could count the incident photons. This tube was mounted to a turntable with adjustable orientation by stepper motors. The output of the PMT was fed through a series of amplifiers, filters, and counters. 
![[Pasted image 20240921232117.png]]
*Figure 2 - Radioactive source, turntable, and detector*

- Took an initial reading of a dosimeter before attaching it to my clothing. 
- Checked electronics were set up correctly.  
![[Pasted image 20240921232137.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240921232207.png]]
*Figure 3 - Electronics*

- Started ADMCA software.
- Started Compton app to control the stepper motors. Could not connect to the stepper motor. Checked the connection of the stepper motor system. Realised the power was not turned on. Turned on the power, and the Compton app successfully connected to the stepper motors. 
- Calibrated the position of the turntable to 0 degrees. 
- Turned on the MCA for a few seconds, observed a distribution of counts. 
![[Pasted image 20240921231711.png]]
*Figure 4 - First Distribution at 0 angles and attenuation*

- Opened the shutter to the chamber containing Cs-137 atoms, and turned on the MCA. The distribution grew much faster than before, which is to be expected for an exposed Cs137 source. 
### 2.2 Count Calibration
- The measured peak energies were expected to undesirably vary when the count rate changed. In order to choose a count rate that had relatively accurate peak energy measurements, this undesirable behaviour must be measured. 
- For the same angle of 0 degrees, I obtained the count distribution received by the apparatus, for varying levels of attenuation. This was done by adding copper plates in front of the PMT, each with thickness 6.35mm. 
![[Pasted image 20240921233433.png|400]]
*Figure 5 - Example attenuation by placing copper plates in front of detector*

- I turned off the source, locked the hatch with a padlock, and shut down everything. 
- I took the dosimeter off my clothing, and recorded the radiation level. There was no noticeable change compared to the start of the lab. 
- 2 days later, I arrived at the lab. 
- I opened the count graphs in the ADMCA software one by one, and selected the regions of interest, and obtained the information relevant to the peaks. The bounds for the regions of interest were taken to be about 3 standard deviations on either side of the peak. 
- To verify that the software gave the correct results, I exported the .mca files and performed a fit in python, with a gaussian model on top of a linear background. The uncertainties were chosen to be $\sqrt{counts}$, due to the process being Poisson. 
![[Pasted image 20240912125504.png]]
*Figure 6 - First test fit of a peak using Python*

- The fit had a reduced $\chi^2$ of 1.23 and $R^2$ of 0.99, indicating a very good fit with appropriately determined uncertainties. The results were: 
	- Peak position: 825
	- Net area (of the gaussian): 19867
	- Full Width at Half Maximum: 60.84
	- Net count rate: 323
- Compared to the ADMCA software result of a centroid of 825, I was confident the software would produce accurate readings. 
- I plotted the count rates against the thickness of copper, which appears to be an exponential decay. This matches the mathematics of attenuation where the number of gamma rays that pass through every unit length of copper is proportional to the number of gamma rays that are incident on that unit length of copper. This results in a first order differential equation that has an exponential solution.
![[Pasted image 20240912124540.png]]
*Figure 7 - Effect of copper thickness on count rate*

- I plotted the measured centroid positions against the thickness of copper.
![[Pasted image 20240912124945.png]]
*Figure 8 - Effect of energy channels by count rate*

- The graph appears to have a steep decline for low attenuation, and a very slow decline for high attenuation. 
- The elbow of the curve is situated at the data point associated with 4 copper slabs. (The first data point is 0 slabs) But the first point where the curve enters the plateau region is at 6 slabs. This corresponds to **a count rate of 2428**. This ought to be the maximum count rate of the experiment, so that the measured energies do not become too inaccurate. 
### 2.3 Energy Calibration 
- I placed the weaker radioactive samples on the detector arm, propped up by copper plates to place it in line of sight of the detector tube. 
![[Pasted image 20240922122312.png|400]]
*Figure 9 - Example of radioactive sample placed in the path of the detector for energy calibration*

- I rotated the turntable to 45 degrees so that the Cs137 sample leakage radiation would not contaminate the measurements. 
- I started data acquisition. For the Am, Ba and Cs samples, the counts quickly grew. For the Na sample, the counts grew slowly and the features looked very jagged, so I waited for minutes instead of one minute. 
- I plotted the photon energy vs channel number, and FWHM vs channel number. Both resemble a positive linear relationship. 
![[Pasted image 20240912141458.png]]
*Figure 10 - Energy vs Channel*
![[Pasted image 20240912141512.png]]
*Figure 11 - FWHM vs energy*

- I entered those results into the calibration of the ADMCA software. 
- I returned the turntable to 0 degrees, removed the copper plates and the weaker radioactive sources, opened the Cs137 shutter and recorded the radiation spectrum, making sure that the count rate was below the threshold where inaccuracies grow too large, by placing 6 copper plates in front of the detector. 
- I recorded the calibrated spectrum of the Cs137. 
![[Pasted image 20240922135353.png]]
*Figure 12 - Energy-calibrated spectrum at 0 degrees*

- There is one dominant gaussian peak at $667 keV$, corresponding to the unscattered Cs137 radiation with nominal energy $662keV$ [3]. 
- There are two low and wide gaussian peaks at around $200keV$ and $444keV$. These two low peaks are present in every measured spectrum. 
- The $200keV$ peak doesn't change with the turntable angle. This suggests that these peaks are a result of an angle-invariant phenomenon, like fluorescence (when the original gamma rays get absorbed by the shielding, sample holder, or the detector itself, and the material emits a 200keV photon randomly in all directions). However, no such element with 200keV transition was found during research. 
- The $440keV$ peak moves moves with the turntable angle. It actually moves by the same amount as the dominant peak. This will be investigated later in the analysis section. 
### 2.4 Variation of Scattering Angle
- I removed the copper slabs, inserted a 21mm collimator into the PMT tube, and a brass rod in line of the Cs137 radiation beam. I set the turn table to 30 degrees. 
![[Pasted image 20240922184148.png|400]]
*Figure 13 - Collimator inserted into detector tube*

- I recorded the spectrum. Since the total photon rate was around 135, far below the threshold of inaccuracy, I noted to myself not to insert any copper plates to attenuate the radiation. 
- I waited until the peak reached 200 counts so that the percentage uncertainty of the peak count was about $\sqrt{200}/200\approx 7$ percent. I intended to do this for all other measurements. 
- I collected the spectrum of scattering angles from 30 to 120 degrees with 10 degree increments. Once I was done, I did a quick fit of the data in wavelengths against Equation (5), to determined whether I needed to collect data again. 
![[Pasted image 20240922185427.png]]
*Figure 14 - First fit of the shifted wavelength against scattering angle*

- The data visually had a good fit. The Compton wavelength should be $h/m_ec\approx 2.43\times 10^{-12} m$, which is on the correct order of magnitude as can be visually checked on this graph. However, the $R^2$ value is in the order of 16, which suggests something horrible had happened in the numerical algorithm. The $\chi^2$ of 1.48 suggests a reasonable uncertainty estimation, albeit slightly under estimated. This would be remedied in the Analysis section, where the peak energies would be determined by fitting in python, along with the uncertainty in the peak. 
# 3 Analysis and Discussion
### 3.1 Obtaining the Peaks from the Spectra using Fitting
- For every spectrum, I selected a region that visually appeared to cover at least 3 standard deviations on both sides of the peak. I fit a gaussian added to a linear function to these regions, and obtained the peak positions and their uncertainties - as the mean and uncertainty of the mean in the fit results. An example fit is shown below. 
![[Pasted image 20240922195808.png]]
*Figure 15 - Proper fit of the peak shapes in Python*

- The fit qualities are summarised by the $R^2$ and reduced $\chi^2$ values in the table below.

*Table 1 - Fit qualities for each spectrum, rounded to 2 decimal places.* 

| Angles               | 30   | 40   | 50   | 60   | 70   | 80   | 90   | 100  | 110  | 120  |
| -------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **$R^2$**            | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| **reduced $\chi^2$** | 0.97 | 1.38 | 1.02 | 1.05 | 1.08 | 0.95 | 1.23 | 1.25 | 0.94 | 0.99 |
- From the $R^2\approx 1.00$ it can be seen that the fits were all able to explain all of the variation in the data. From the reduced $\chi^2$ all being close to 1 it can be seen that the data had appropriately estimated uncertainties. This is to be expected considering the Poisson process is a very well understood process with a standard deviation of square root of the values. 
### 3.2 Plotting the Compton Shifts
- With the measured peaks and their uncertainties, I plotted the wavelength of the scattered photon with Equation (5) and the energy of the scattered photon with Equation (6). 
![[Pasted image 20240922220249.png]]
*Figure 16 - Wavelength shift of compton scattering, with updated data*

![[Pasted image 20240922220303.png]]
*Figure 17 - Energy shift of Compton scattering with updated data*

- The fits are visually good, but there are a few problems:
	1. The errorbars are very small for both
	2. The reduced $\chi^2$ of 46 for both fits are very large
	3. The $R^2$ for the wavelength is still on the order of 10 to the 6, meaning there is some catastrophic numerical failure in the algorithm due to the extreme orders of magnitude involved in the calculations. For this reason, only the energy relationship will be considered moving forward. 
- The above problems suggest the uncertainties are severely underestimated. I believe that directly taking the output of the fitting algorithm is not a good way to measure the uncertainty in the peaks. Rather, I should follow a more intuitive approach. 
- The true peak could be anywhere within a relatively flat region of the gaussian around the mean. Taking a count threshold to be within 1.5% of the gaussian peak, the energy ranges roughly 1.8 standard deviations. With the new uncertainties, I plotted the energy again.
![[Pasted image 20240922223234.png]]
*Figure 18 - Energy shift of Compton Scattering with corrected uncertainties*

- This time, the reduced $\chi^2$ is approximately 0.95, which suggests the uncertainties are more appropriately estimated. 
- The result of the fit parameters are:
	1. $\boxed{E=664\pm5keV}$, which is accurate to the nominal gamma ray energy of Cs137 - 662keV within half a standard deviation. 
	2. $\epsilon=1.31\pm0.02$
Where $\epsilon:=E/m_ec^2$, a combined parameter that made the fitting algorithm easier to converge. 
- From this, the electron mass was determined by:
$$m_e=\frac{E}{\epsilon c^2}$$
- And the uncertainty of the electron mass was determined by adding uncertainties in quadrature: 
$$u_{m_e}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon c^2}u_E\right)^2+\left(\frac{E}{\epsilon^2c^2}u_\epsilon\right)^2}$$
- The result is: 
$$\boxed{m_e=(9.02\pm0.07)\times10^{-31}kg}$$
Which is accurate to the actual electron mass of $9.1\times10^{-31}kg$ [4] at about 1 standard deviation. 
### 3.3 The Origin of the 444keV Peak 
- In Section 2.3 - Energy Calibration, a plot of the spectrum of photon energies at 0 degrees was obtained. Additional to the 667keV peak for the unscattered Cs137 radiation, there was another low peak at 444keV. 
- I posit that this peak is the result of the incident photons travelling through the entirety of the detector while unabsorbed, then scattering off the back of the detector by 180 degrees, and getting absorbed into the detector on this reverse journey. All other scattering angles within the detector result in the wide spread of back scattered photon energies. 
- To test this theory, I calculated the shifted energy of a 180 degree scattering of a 667keV photon:
$$E^\prime=\frac{E}{1+\frac{E}{m_ec^2}(1-\cos(180\degree))}=185keV$$
- Since this did not match 444keV, my theory was wrong. This cannot explain the 200keV peak either, because the 200keV peak does not move when the photon energy changes (when the turntable rotates). 
# 4 Conclusion 
Gamma ray spectroscopy was performed, and the Compton energy shift relationship was quantitatively measured. The result was a well fit using the Compton scattering theory, producing an $R^2\approx1.00$. Using the fit, the energy of the Caesium-137 source was determined to be $664\pm5keV$, within half a standard deviation from the nominal value of $662keV$. The mass of the electron was determined to be $(9.02\pm0.07)\times 10^{-31}kg$, within approximately $1\sigma$ of the official value of $9.1\times10^{-31}kg$. Extra peaks in the spectra were identified, but no satisfactory explanation was found.
