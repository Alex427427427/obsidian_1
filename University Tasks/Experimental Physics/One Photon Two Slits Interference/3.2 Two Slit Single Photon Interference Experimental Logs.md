# Aim
To observe and quantitatively measure the two-slit interference pattern of a monochromatic source in two situations: one using a laser that emits a barrage of photons, allowing multiple photons to be present in the apparatus simultaneously, and another with a source that emits only one photon at a time, thus observing the wave-particle duality of light. 
# 1 Background Theory
### 1.1 Derivation of Double Slit Interference Pattern 
Young's double slit experiment demonstrated that light propagated like a wave. In the experiment, coherent light shone through two closely spaced parallel slits, producing an interference pattern a distance away from the slits. 

This phenomena is conforms to wave mechanics, in which Fourier optics (**Source: Hecht E, Optics Chapter 11: Fourier Optics**) easily derives the exact mathematical form of the interference pattern. Consider coherent light propagating along the optical axis $z$, and passes through a double slit filter at $z=z_0$. This double slit has an aperture function $A(x)$ along the transverse dimension $x$ to the optical axis. In the ideal case, the aperture function along the transverse dimension $y$ is constant, so there is no consideration of that second dimension. The aperture function of the double slit must be:
$$\boxed{A(x)=\Theta(\frac{a}{2}+\frac{b}{2}-x)+\Theta(x-\frac{a}{2}+\frac{b}{2})+\Theta(-\frac{a}{2}+\frac{b}{2}-x)+\Theta(x+\frac{a}{2}+\frac{b}{2})}$$
Where $\Theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function, $a$ is the distance between the center of the two slits, and $b$ is the width of each slit. The double slit pair is centered at the optical axis. 
![[double slit aperture'.png]]
*Figure 1: Aperture function of an optical axis centered double slit*

Fourier optics describes that the far-field wave amplitude distribution $\Psi(x)$ is proportional to the Fourier transform of the aperture function. Thus:
$$\Psi(x)\propto\mathcal F[A(x^\prime)](x)$$
$$\Psi(x)\propto\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}A(x^\prime)e^{-ik_xx^\prime}dx^\prime$$
Where $k_x:=kx/r\approx kx/z$ in the paraxial approximation. $k$ is the total wave vector of the incident light and $r$ is the distance from the detection location $(x,z)$ to the source location $(x^\prime, z_0)$. 

The Heaviside functions effectively restrict the integration domain to $[-\frac{a}{2}-\frac{b}{2}, -\frac{a}{2}+\frac{b}{2}]$ and $[\frac{a}{2}-\frac{b}{2}, \frac{a}{2}+\frac{b}{2}]$, where $A(x)=1$. Thus
$$\Psi(x)\propto\int_{-\frac{a}{2}-\frac{b}{2}}^{-\frac{a}{2}+\frac{b}{2}}e^{-ik_xx^\prime}dx^\prime+\int_{\frac{a}{2}-\frac{b}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}+\frac{b}{2}}e^{-ik_xx^\prime}dx^\prime$$
$$\Psi(x)\propto\left[\frac{e^{-ik_xx^\prime}}{-ik_x}\right]_{-\frac{a}{2}-\frac{b}{2}}^{-\frac{a}{2}+\frac{b}{2}}+\left[\frac{e^{-ik_xx^\prime}}{-ik_x}\right]_{\frac{a}{2}-\frac{b}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}+\frac{b}{2}}$$
$$\Psi(x)\propto e^{ik_xa/2}\left(\frac{e^{-ik_xb/2}-e^{ik_xb/2}}{-ik_x}\right)+e^{-ik_xa/2}\left(\frac{e^{-ik_xb/2}-e^{ik_xb/2}}{-ik_x}\right)$$
$$\Psi(x)\propto \frac{2}{k_x}e^{ik_xa/2}\left(\frac{e^{ik_xb/2}-e^{-ik_xb/2}}{2i}\right)+\frac{2}{k_x}e^{-ik_xa/2}\left(\frac{e^{ik_xb/2}-e^{-ik_xb/2}}{2i}\right)$$
Using the trig id $\sin(m)=(e^{im}-e^{-im})/2i$:
$$\Psi(x)\propto \frac{2}{k_x}e^{ik_xa/2}\sin{\left(k_xb/2\right)}+\frac{2}{k_x}e^{-ik_xa/2}\sin\left(k_xb/2\right)$$
$$\Psi(x)\propto b\frac{2}{k_xb}e^{ik_xa/2}\sin{\left(k_xb/2\right)}+b\frac{2}{k_xb}e^{-ik_xa/2}\sin\left(k_xb/2\right)$$
$$\Psi(x)\propto be^{ik_xa/2}sinc{\left(k_xb/2\right)}+be^{-ik_xa/2}sinc\left(k_xb/2\right)$$
$$\Psi(x)\propto b\left(e^{ik_xa/2}+e^{-ik_xa/2}\right)sinc{\left(k_xb/2\right)}$$
$$\Psi(x)\propto 2b\frac{e^{ik_xa/2}+e^{-ik_xa/2}}{2}sinc{\left(k_xb/2\right)}$$
Using the trig id $\cos(m)=(e^{im}+e^{-im})/2$:
$$\Psi(x)\propto 2b\ sinc{\left(k_xb/2\right)}\cos(k_xa/2)$$
So the intensity $I:=|\Psi|^2$ is proportional to the above function squared: 
$$I\propto sinc^2(k_xb/2)\cos^2(k_xa/2)$$
In other words, invoking $I_0$ as the proportionality constant:
$$I=I_0sinc^2(k_xb/2)\cos^2(k_xa/2)$$
Since $k_x=kx/z=2\pi x/z\lambda$ where $\lambda=2\pi/k$ is the wavelength of the incident light: 
$$I=I_0sinc^2(\pi\frac{b}{\lambda}\frac{x}{z})\cos^2(\pi\frac{a}{\lambda}\frac{x}{z})$$
Since the double slit may not be centered at the optical axis, or the incident beam may have some angular offset: 
$$I=I_0sinc^2(\pi\frac{b}{\lambda}\frac{x-x_0}{z})\cos^2(\pi\frac{a}{\lambda}\frac{x-x_0}{z})$$
The $sinc$ function's central lobe has a half width of $\pi$ in the domain. Programming languages use the normalised $sinc$ function where the central lobe has a half width of 1. Thus, defining the normalised $sinc(x)$ to be the regular $sinc(\pi x)$, we have:
$$\boxed{I=I_0sinc^2(\frac{b}{\lambda}\frac{x-x_0}{z})\cos^2(\pi\frac{a}{\lambda}\frac{x-x_0}{z})}$$
Which results in the intensity distribution shown in Figure 2.
![[double slit pattern.png]]
*Figure 2: Double Slit intensity Distribution*

We may interpret the expression $x/z$ as angle $\theta$ in the paraxial limit. Thus: 
$$I=I_0sinc^2(\frac{b}{\lambda}(\theta-\theta_0))\cos^2(\pi\frac{a}{\lambda}(\theta-\theta_0))$$
However, I anticipate this form of the equation to be less useful than the boxed version above, since the measurements taken will be directly over $x$, not an angle $\theta$. 
### 1.2 Particle Nature of Light
Max Planck posited that electromagnetic radiation consisted of discrete energy units that obeyed the law 
$$\boxed{E=h\nu}$$
Where $E$ is the energy of the energy unit, $h$ is the Planck's constant, $\nu$ is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave. Planck posited this in order to solve the ultraviolet catastrophe, but was not convinced of the particle nature of light itself. He hoped that perhaps a more sophisticated application of wave mechanics would allow the apparent discrete nature of light to be derived as an emergent phenomenon. (**Source: Thomas Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, page 150**)

In 1905, Albert Einstein applied this discrete energy idea to explain the photoelectric effect, further supporting the particle nature of light. 

The above developments raise a question. If light is a particle, then would a single instance of it produce interference when shot through a double slit? In this experiment, photons will be emitted along a chamber of length $L$, to pass through a double slit and end up at the detection slit. How can we make sure that only a single photon travels through the apparatus at any given time? 

Since the photon travels at the speed of light $c$, the time $t$ it takes for a photon to propagate from the source to the screen is $L/c$. The maximum allowable frequency of photon emission is calculated by assuming a new photon is emitted immediately following the absorption of the previous photon. This means the maximum emission frequency $f_{max}$ is $1/t$:
$$\boxed{f_{max}=\frac{c}{L}}$$
So long as the detected frequency is much lower than this, we can be certain that every photon completes the journey from source to detector alone. 
# 2 Log of the Experiment
### 2.1 Initial Set up
- I arrive at the lab, turn off the room light and examine the apparatus. 
![[apparatus.png]]
*Figure 3: Double Slit Single Photon Apparatus. Note that in the non-single photon case, there is an additional digital multimeter to measure the voltage of the photodiode attached to the shutter rod. (**Source: Monash School of Physics PHS3000 Lab Manual, 3.2 Two-Slit Interference One Photon at a Time**)*

- I make sure that everything was turned off, and push the shutter rod all the way in, before removing the lid. 
- I study what is inside.
- I see that the left end contains everything related to the source, with a red laser option and a green bulb option, with controllable intensity. There is a slit at S1 for collimation, S2 for the main interference effect, a slit blocker to turn the double slit into a single slit, and a slit at S3 to select the light hitting a particular transverse location to the optical axis. Beyond the S3 detection slit, there is a photodiode to detect the laser light, attached to a shutter rod. The shutter rod, when pushed down, places the photodiode behind the S3 slit and blocks the light from hitting the Photomultiplier (PMT) module used for detecting single photons. The photodiode output is connected to a digital multimeter to display the detected voltage which corresponds to a light intensity. The working of the PMT will be explained in the later sections relevant to single photon interference. 
- I examine the available double slits, and practice mounting them onto the magnetic holder at S2. 
### 2.2 Aligning the Laser
- I placed the laser in its fixture and turn it on. I saw the laser on but no light after the first slit, so I adjusted the orientation of the laser holder until I saw a diffracted light pattern pass through. I noticed how sensitive the system was to small adjustments in the orientation of the laser. 
![[mount laser.png|400]]
*Figure 4: laser mounted*

![[papaer detect leser.png|400]]
*Figure 5: Using a piece of paper to test laser alignment*

- I aligned the laser by adjusting the vertical orientation of the holder with an allen key, and the horizontal orientation by rotating the holder horizontally after loosening the thumb screw beneath the apparatus. At last, I obtained a double slit pattern centered at the detection site S3.
![[double slit paper test.png|400]]
*Figure 6: Double slit pattern obtained at detection site*

- Lab time was over, I had to turn everything off and leave the lab. 
### 2.3 Measuring the Double Slit Pattern with Laser
- I returned to the set up on a new day and found the laser to be misaligned. I took out the slits, adjusted the orientation of the laser until the light was centered at the end, and inserted the slits back: a single slit at the start for collimation, a double slit labeled "16" at S2, and a slit blocker. 
- I closed the lid to make sure no ambient light is being detected by the photodiode. 
- I connected the output of the photodiode to the digital multimeter. 
- I varied the S3 micrometer to notice the change in the measured voltage. The voltage jumps between the order of millivolts to the order of hundreds of millivolts. 
- I noticed that it took just a bit less than 1mm for the voltage to vary from minimum to maximum to minimum again. If i want 5 data points per fringe, I should vary the micrometer by 0.2mm per data point. 
- I noticed that the voltage reading fluctuates in the 4th significant figure, and is slightly decreasing over time. Could S3 be every so slowly varying on its own by the force of the spring on the other side of S3? I should take measurements quickly. 
- I put all the measurements into a spreadsheet, and did a quick plot to make sure my data was correct. A more complete treatment of this plot will be done later in python. 
![[double laser.png]]
*Figure 7: spreadsheet scatter plot of the laser's double slit pattern*

- I noticed the maxima and minima, and that there wasn't much voltage measurement in the lowest and highest ranges. I kept this in mind for future measurements. 
- I also noticed that the baseline measurement is around 7.6 mV. 
- Further analysis on this result will be performed after the experiment. 
### 2.4 Measuring the Single Slit Pattern with Laser
- Since I want to capture multiple large lobes for the single slit Fraunhofer pattern, I changed the slit to the one labelled "18", realigned but allowing the whole pattern to be shifted sideways a bit, so I can capture higher order large lobes. 
- I performed a quick scatter plot in excel. A more complete treatment of the plot will be done in python later. 
![[single laser.png]]
*Figure 8: spreadsheet scatter plot of the laser's single slit pattern*

- It was at this point I immediately realised that having a different spacing would not at all affect the single slit Fraunhofer pattern, but only the spacing of the smaller fringes. Nevertheless, the further slit separation helped to make controlling the slit blocker easier. 
### 2.5 Quick Test Fit of the Double Slit Pattern
- I left the lab for lunch, and wrote a python script to fit the double slit data. It was not fitting correctly. 
- After many attempts, I realised that i calculated the initial guesses for the fitting parameters wrong. 
- Firstly, I was implicitly assuming my independent variable $x$ was $\theta$. But in fact I needed to write $x/z$, where $z$ is the distance of the double slit to the detector. 
- Secondly, I was providing the fitting algorithm too many free parameters. I absorbed groups of products and quotients of parameters into a single one, ending up with the form $I_0\ sinc^2(\beta(x-x_0))\cos^2(\alpha(x-x_0))$, where $\beta=b/\lambda z$, $\alpha=\pi a/\lambda z$, $x_0\approx5.4$ by inspection, and $I_0\approx 2200$ by inspection. 
- I measured the distance $z$ between the double slit and the detection slit, found it to be around 492.5 mm, with an uncertainty of 0.5 mm due to the ambiguous thickness of the slit frame, obscuring measurement. 
- The resulting fit was successful.
![[laser double test fit.png]]
*Figure 9: test fit of the laser double slit pattern*
### 2.6 Setting up the Lightbulb for Single Photon Interference
- Aligning the dim lightbulb was incredibly difficult. 
- I turned the entire room dark, covered my work area with black curtains, and turned on the bulb to maximum intensity, and removed the green filter. 
- Beyond the S1 collimating slit, the light that passed through was faint but weakly visible. If I could make sure this slit of light landed directly onto the double slit at S2, I could be confident that the bulb was aligned well to hit to the detection slit S3. 
- I placed a paper right up against S2, and placed my phone torch light near S3, shining backwards at S2. I observed the double slit casting a shadow onto the paper. I adjusted the bulb's orientation until the thin slit of light from S1 landed on a location where the shadow cast by S2 was in its middle. The bulb was aligned. 
![[bulb alignment.png|400]]
*Figure 10: bulb alignment scheme*

- I measured roughly 1m between the bulb and detection slit. This means to ensure there was only one photon in the apparatus at a time, the maximum allowable emission frequency was: 
$$f_{max}=\frac{c}{L}=\frac{3\times10^8}{1}=0.3GHz$$
- So long as the detected frequency was much lower than this, there would be only one photon in the apparatus at a time. 
### 2.7 Optimising the Light Dark Trigger Discrimination
- 2 days later, I returned to the lab and turned everything on. I moved the micrometer to see if I get maxima and minima in the counts. I do, which means the bulb light is still aligned correctly. This makes sense, considering there was no one else that used this equipment in the time I was away. 
- The PMT has a cascade of electrodes with increasing voltage, each with a coat of easily detached electrons. The total PMT arrangement needs to be supplied with a voltage on the order of hundreds of volts. When a single photon hits the front of the PMT, a single electron will be ejected towards the first electrode, which knocks a few electrons off to travel towards the next electrode due to the potential difference, which each knock a few electrons off the next electrode, and so on. Eventually, there is a large rain of electrons on the final electrode, resulting in a measurable electric current and voltage. Then, a digital oscilloscope detects when the voltage from the PMT is above a certain threshold, which represents a photon collision event. A square pulse is generated and fed into a counter, which counts how many such events happen over time. 
- The larger the supplied voltage to the PMT, the higher the rate of photon collision events being registered by the counter. This also includes when the shutter rod is completely down - when the apparatus in internally completely dark. We wish to minimise this noise. 
- I tried to obtain a high count to start the optimisation process for light-dark discrimitation. So I aligned the micrometer until the count was at a maximum. 
- To make searching for the maximum more tractable in the time I have, I reduced the gate time of the counter down. Once I did this, I noticed the count fluctuated a lot. At around 500 counts/s, the fluctuation was roughly 100. I make a note to check the fluctuation at each measurement in the future, to obtain the uncertainties. 
- I found a micrometer position where, given 700V applied to the PMT, the count was around 500. Now that a maximum was found, I turned the gate time back to 10 seconds. 
- I adjusted the PMT voltage, and for each voltage, noted down the counts when the shutter was open (representing the light from the bulb shining on the PMT), and when the shutter was closed (representing the ambient noise in dark conditions). 
- I made sure I stayed at one position for a full 10 second update of the counter, so that my measurements aren't contaminated by the previous measurement. Therefore, I take the second update on the counter as my measurement. 
- I plotted the results in Excel.
![[light dark.png|400]]
*Figure 11: Light and Dark counts*

![[excel_optim.png|400]]
*Figure 12: Light and Dark Count Ratio*

- I noticed a sharp drop between 525 and 500V, so I took more measurements around there to produce a new graph.
![[more meas optim ratio.png|400]]
*Figure 13: More complete light-dark optimisation graph*

- At 525V, the signal to noise ratio is the highest, so I chose this PMT voltage. 
- Additionally, I recorded the uncertainty in the counts with respect to the light level, and produced a table, to be used in future uncertainty analysis. 
### 2.8 Collecting Data for the Single Photon Interference
- I set the PMT voltage to 525V. 
- I had 3.5 hours left, so I did a quick calculation on how finely I should take the measurements. Provided that the slit separation is the same as previously, and the slit width is the same, and the wavelength of the bulb's green light ($545 nm$) is slightly shorter than the red laser light ($670nm$), the fringes will be ever so slightly closer together compared to the laser. For the laser pattern, there were roughly 5 fringes within 4 mm, meaning there was 0.8mm per fringe. So, using the proportionality of the fringe spacing to the wavelength, the green light from the bulb should produce $0.8 \times\frac{545}{670}=0.65mm$. 
- Suppose I took 5 points per fringe; that means I needed to move in increments of roughly $0.125mm$, meaning there would be 8 measurements per mm, so 64 measurements over the range of 1mm to 9mm. If I had to wait 20 seconds per measurement, that is $64\times20=1280s\approx21min$, which meant I had more than enough time. 
- I moved the micrometer to 9mm, making sure to only move down to avoid hysteresis. Then I took measurements by waiting for the second 10s update at every location, to avoid the previous measurement interfering with the current one. I took measurements with increments of $0.125mm$. 
- I noticed the count still fluctuates over subsequent 10s updates, so I decided to record the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th update. This would still leave me enough time to complete the experiment. 
- I obtained the plot of the double slit pattern, and did a quick scatter plot in excel to make sure my data had the necessary features. They did. 
![[bulb double excel pattern.png]]
*Figure 14: Excel Scatterplot of the Single Photon Double Slit Interference Pattern*
### 2.9 Quick Test Fitting of the Pattern in Python
- I put the data into a python file, supplied the model and the initial guess for the parameters, calculated from the parameters supplied in the lab manual, and plotted. 
![[bulb double slit fit.png]]
*Figure 15: Python test fit of the single photon double slit interference pattern*

- Seeing that I obtained a successful fit, I packed up and left.
