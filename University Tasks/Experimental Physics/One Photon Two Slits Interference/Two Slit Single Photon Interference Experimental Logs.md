### 3.1 Initial Set up
{Explain what the set up consists of}
- I arrive at the lab, turn off the room light and examine the apparatus. 
- I make sure that everything was turned off, and push the shutter rod all the way in, before removing the lid. 
- I study what is inside.
- I examine the available double slits, and practice mounting them onto the magnetic holder at S2. 
- I place the laser in its fixture and turn it on. I see the laser on but no light after the first slit, so I adjust the orientation of the laser holder until I see a diffracted light pattern pass through. I notice how sensitive the system is to small adjustments in the orientation of the laser.
- I aligned the laser by adjusting the vertical orientation of the holder with an allen key, and the horizontal orientation by rotating the holder horizontally after loosening the thumb screw beneath the apparatus.
