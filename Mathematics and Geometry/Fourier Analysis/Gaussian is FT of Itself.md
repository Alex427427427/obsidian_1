It is known that in harmonic analysis or fourier analysis, functions in reciprocal domains are actually distributions of harmonic elements in each other. 

Is there a special distribution which is the Fourier Transform of itself? 

That function is the Gaussian function. 
$$f(t)=e^{-t^2}$$
In particular, an appropriately scaled gaussian function has the exact same form under the Fourier Transform. 
$$f(t)=e^{-\pi t^2}$$
$$\hat f(\xi)=e^{-\pi \xi^2}$$
