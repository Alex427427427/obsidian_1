___
The most important property of the real numbers. 
## Various Equivalent Theorems
There are no gaps in the real numbers. 
##### Least Upper Bound Property
Every non empty subset of the real numbers that has an upper bound must have a least upper bound. 
##### Dedekind Completeness
A unique real number sits at the boundary of any partition of the real numbers into two non-empty complementary sets. 
##### Cauchy Completeness
Every Cauchy sequency of real numbers converges to a real number. (Rationals do not have this property)
