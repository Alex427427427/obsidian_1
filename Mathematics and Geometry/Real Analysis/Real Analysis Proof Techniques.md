## Technique 1
$$(A\subseteq B\ \& B\subseteq A) \iff (A=B)$$
## Technique 2 - for $a/b$
If $a\in R$ and $b\in R$, $b\neq 0$, consider $a/b$. 

Make both $a$ and $b$ positive. 

To find upper bound of $a/b$, find upper bound of $a$ called $\alpha$, positive lower bound of $b$ called $\beta$. The upper bound is $\alpha/\beta$.

To find lower bound of $a/b$, find positive lower bound of $a$ called $\alpha$, upper bound of $b$ called $\beta$. The lower bound is $\alpha/\beta$.
