I want to give a shot at:
1. Constructing a geometric model of photon, electron, positron structure, interaction, spin and action. See if it's really possible that electrons and positrons are photons of opposite helicity made to infinitesimally orbit in place - in essence, photon clocks. 
2. See if the above generalises to other forces and elementary particles. If all physical processes can be reduced to photon clocks, then lorentz transformations automatically arise for frames' apparent experience of time and space, and that a true absolute frame exists that is stationary relative to the ether. 
3. Come up with possible process of non-local contraction of the wave function; see its consequences under lorentz transformations. 
5. See if gravity can emerge from residual effects of electromagnetism. 
6. See if gravity can emerge from extra gauge symmetries e.g. conformal scaling over space-time. 
7. See if ER=EPR. 

To do the above, I need to:
1. Learn Diff Geo
2. Learn Lie Theory
3. Learn Condensed Matter Physics
4. Learn QFT, QED, QCD, weak interaction, basically all of the standard model
5. Learn GR
6. Learn Clifford (spacetime) algebra?
7. See Twistor Theory?
