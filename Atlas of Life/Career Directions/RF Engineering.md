## Pros
Allows me to become the best electrical engineer i could be. 

Electromagnetics is beautiful. [[Electromagnetism]]

Useful in industry. 
## Cons
Maybe not that directly helpful to people's lives? 
## Information Gathering
- "Lack of creativity in board level RF these days... interesting work is done at the IC level, but 60 hour work weeks can get fucked" - reddit user, 10 year RF engineer after masters. 
- "Don't go into HW. HW work is being farmed to Asia." - reddit user, 10 year consumer RF
- "There are quite a few RF jobs out there so availability isn't a problem; there aren't many applicants. Been easy to land a position, but hasn't been fun at all; saturated by veterans." - reddit user, 5-6 years experience
- "Actual networking is done by FPGA and ASIC people. The RF folks do EM sims and poke at things in the lab, test antennas in EMC chambers and document." 
- "RF hardware used to be way more complicated, but now most of the interesting work is done on the IC side. Most RF harware just use baseband chips, trx chips, power supply ic, and passives like filters. If you like rf, go with RFIC. If you want money, go with cs. If you are worried about the saturation of the job market in CS, RF market is already fully saturated. Most of the jobs listings are in Asia now. Analog IC design is safe from that; only a handful of companies are doing it outside the US. In RF, with 10 years of experience, you'll get around $250k in a high cost area. CS people will get $500k." - same reddit user, 10 years after masters.
- "It depends on location and how important making money is to you. You won't get SW salary anywhere, you also won't make as much as digital in HFT but you make slightly better than everyone else (in EE) but only if you're in design. If you are just testing you won't make as much and that goes for any field within EE. Also consider different industries; defense is good and work on a lot of frequency ranges; good WLB and reasonable pay if you're good, in design, and regularly advocate for yourself. Commercial is ok but limited in freq range and limited in scope, and probably worse WLB. Need to get masters; hard to move up without it, most places require it for entry to begin with. RFICs are pretty hot rn but requires a ton of tapeout experience, can be quite tough. Board design is still valuable and requires expertise but not as much as RFIC design - less variables, less risky, lower cost. Don't think it's going anywhere tho."
- "I work in RF for a top defense company and i enjoy it. The division within RF makes all the difference. I work with public and military comms and it's fun especially if you like to travel."
- "I don't work in RF but i have friends and they do pretty well. Defense in my area is always looking for RF engineers, especially in the Dahlgren immediate area. You will still need to learn to code well. Pay is pretty good but good is relative. I know some recent grads started around 110-120k. That may sound high to euros but pay in US can be way more in engineering."
- "If you're a US citizen I would defs consider working for Defense or gov."
- "Yes, do it, those 40 year old vets will retire."
- "Did my PhD in RF/MW devices and ICs, while I found the subject matter and history very interesting, the industry people I met convinced me that I don't want to be there. Many smart people but so arrogant and bitter and defensive of their little kingdoms. This was around 2015. I made the choice to go for silicon baseband semiconductors instead."
- "Over a decade of work. Don't recommend because high entry barrier - analog CMOS design, microwave theory, RF board design, signal processing... and industry consolidation, RF solutions mostly sold as modules and turn key solutions. Companies still need engineers with RF knowledge, but not RF engineer."
- "I recommend getting an amateur radio license cus you learn a lot and shows that you're actually interested in the subject."
- "10 years. Good career if in defense industry. Governments always want new satellites, payloads, missiles, radios etc. May not be the most glamorous job with a lot of desk work but you also get to be in the lab with testing or building."
- "I run an RF team. They design and build antennas, test in chambers and outdoor, run simulations on high-end servers, and help compliance team troubleshooting EMI issues. They also interpret compliance requirements worldwide, and ensure that our products meet or exceed other countries' requirements. They also prototype their antennas with precision milling. Additionally they study protocols and help firmware team debug radio code. In larger companies most of the above are individual specialists, but in medium to small sized companies engineers have to wear different hats. My EE lab has installed RF chambers, test antenna, RF equipment, spectrum analysers, Anritsus, CM-55's, total >$3M. RF gets the best toys."
