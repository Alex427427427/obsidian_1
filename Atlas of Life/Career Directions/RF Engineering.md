## Pros
Allows me to become the best electrical engineer i could be. 

Electromagnetics is beautiful. [[Electromagnetism]]

Useful in industry. 
## Cons
Maybe not that directly helpful to people's lives? 
## Information Gathering
- "Lack of creativity in board level RF these days... interesting work is done at the IC level, but 60 hour work weeks can get fucked" - reddit user, 10 year RF engineer after masters. 
- "Don't go into HW. HW work is being farmed to Asia." - reddit user, 10 year consumer RF
- "There are quite a few RF jobs out there so availability isn't a problem; there aren't many applicants. Been easy to land a position, but hasn't been fun at all; saturated by veterans." - reddit user, 5-6 years experience
- "Actual networking is done by FPGA and ASIC people. The RF folks do EM sims and poke at things in the lab, test antennas in EMC chambers and document." 
- "RF hardware used to be way more complicated, but now most of the interesting work is done on the IC side. Most RF harware just use baseband chips, trx chips, power supply ic, and passives like filters. If you like rf, go with RFIC. If you want money, go with cs. If you are worried about the saturation of the job market in CS, RF market is already fully saturated. Most of the jobs listings are in Asia now. Analog IC design is safe from that; only a handful of companies are doing it outside the US. In RF, with 10 years of experience, you'll get around $250k in a high cost area. CS people will get $500k." - same reddit user, 10 years after masters.
