## The me I must pretend to be 
There is the me that is intensely driven to obtain achievement, status and some specific career trajectory. The me that has career aspirations as my center-most passion. The me that I must pretend to be in front of a recruiter, in my resume, in my cover letter. The me that says shit like "I've always been passionately driven by a career in data science". This is the me that always looks towards the future. The me that is anxious and never feels at peace. 

This is the me that makes me miserable. The me that is never satisfied. The me that feels desperation looking at every direction around me, because my path was not optimised for success in one field. The me that feels angry at everyone for lying to me, or for not having the answers to a younger me that needed them. 

This false "me" is particularly invasive, because it grabs hold of the things that are supposed to be the deepest part of us - our prime cause. Our aspirations, our dreams, the thing that makes us want to get out of bed and do anything. Yet counter intuitively, this me makes me feel unmotivated, and that life has no meaning. This me is hyper goal focused, hyper critical of the value of things, and always asks "what's the point of this? (if not advancing something else?)"

When I feel those negative emotions of jealousy, regret, anger, annoyance, it is caused by the invasion of this falsehood. 
## Me
There is also the me that doesn't really care. The me that is present. The me that just wants to observe my surroundings in peace. The me that weeps for a touching story. The me that has a glimpse of the bigger picture of life. The me that loves being surrounded by my friends. The me that feels inspired to create art. 

This me is happy and peaceful. This me forgives all things. This me feels like life is meaningful. This me doesn't fear being alone. 
## The Struggle 
What could be more virtuous than the struggle to dismantle falsehood, and to discover and protect the truth? 

"Career and love are not my be all and end all. I can always find a way to live. I don't have to be exceptional. I don't have to be loved. I must preserve the real me - who loves beauty and truth above all else."

This is something I must regularly remind myself.
