___
- I will die in the next 50-70 years. 
- Providing value to society is not my ultimate purpose (an attempt at it is merely a social contract I want to abide by). My career is not my ultimate purpose. Achieving the optimal position in life is not my ultimate purpose. Finding love is not my ultimate purpose. 
- The only true failure in life is becoming a real asshole. 
- Even if I am not exceptional, I can live. Even if I'm not loved, I can live. No matter where I end up, I can live. 
- That's because even the most fortunate of roads leads to one destination - old and sitting alone, watching the world go by. You can always interrogate: "what was it all for?" 
- Being able to face the end with dignity is the last best thing I could do. If I tried hard to be a good human, then that would be enough. 
- What makes a good human? A being that acts rationally and socially, and seeks truth and beauty. 
- I must preserve the real me - who values truth and beauty above all else.
- For what I value, I am lovable.
