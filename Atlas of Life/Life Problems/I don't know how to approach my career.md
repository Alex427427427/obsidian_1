## The First Problem - Which Field
I don't know which field to go into. The options are:
1. [[RF Engineering]], basically RF engineering, can enter with relative ease
2. [[Theoretical Physics Research]], most interested field in life, but is an almost complete direction change. Not sure how much study or connections required. 
3. [[Photonics Research]], basically applied QED, forces me to learn theory but also could be relevant to improving/revolutionising electronics. Somewhat of a career change but kind of segways from electromagnetics. 
4. [[Rover Engineer]], just simple engineering. Not even sure electrical or software. Can enter with relative ease, but am not convinced of its usefulness. 
5. [[Nuclear Engineering]], engineering that requires me to learn lots of physics theory. Know that it's good for society, but with small doubts recently. 
## The Second Problem - When to Insert Job Experience
How am I going to fit a complete job experience into my timeline? I want to do a PhD but am afraid of my lack of job experience in the field for job search after graduation. I feel really behind already with my age.
