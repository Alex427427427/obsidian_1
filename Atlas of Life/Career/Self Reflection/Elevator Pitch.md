Hi, I am Alex. I'm in the final year of a Mechatronics Engineering and Physics double degree, looking for an internship or entry level position at a company that values employee growth. I've been told I'm a fast learner due to my solid academic foundation in a wide breadth of STEM topics and I intend to never stop learning. I have 3 years of experience in designing and implementing electrical and software systems for a mars rover, which has given me the chance to do incredibly diverse projects.
