## Are you familiar with what our company does? Or how our technologies work?
Yeah I looked into your company a bit, I know you provide satellite networking services for homes, airplanes, government communications. 
You acquired quite a lot of companies on your way up in the past 40 years. 
One thing I found quite interesting is your effort to model low earth orbit carrying capacity, so that space activites can be conducted responsibly and other people's opportunities to utilise it are preserved. I found that quite nice. 

But I'd love to hear more about the company and the role from your perspective. 
## Tell me about yourself
I'm in a Mechatronics Engineering and Physics double degree graduating next year, looking for an internship at a company that values helping their interns grow. 

I have 3 years of experience in designing and implementing electrical and software systems for a mars rover, which has given me the chance to do incredibly diverse projects. Also completed quite a few challenging software projects. 

I'm a fast learner due to my solid academic foundation in a wide breadth of STEM topics. 

I'm a deep learner as well so I don't just gather facts but actually try to understand the underlying principles. 

and I never wanna stop learning. 

My current main interests are RF electronics and electromagnetics. (why i like it? It's pretty physics heavy, the maths is very pretty. There is signal related maths involved as well. I like to dive deep into things so I feel like this field can allow me to do that. ) 

I am a very social person, I like to maintain a team environment that is joyful - within reason you know. Like we're not just playing around. But as it turns out, a lot of hands on troubleshooting issues and bugs are funny. 

(Example, once the wheel just started beyblading. )
## Why do you want this role?
I wanna learn and become a better engineer. That's my top priority right now. As someone about to graduate.  

I love diving deep into things so I feel like this field allows me to do that. 

Satellite communications matches so well with my interest in Rf electronics and space technologies. I know it seems like a role that has a lot of software involved, but I'm comfortable with software. I've done some challenging AI and data analysis projects. 

It's the same way I got into Nova Rover. I wanted to do space stuff. Been trying since year 1. Tried twice, didn't get in, realised i needed to increase some hands on exp, on the third time got in. 
## How do you work in a team? What's your working style? 

## What was a challenging situation you had to overcome? 
Working with an Arm team. They were 

Realised I didn't have enough preparation. on my own part. 

GAve them options to choose from. 
## When did you resolve a conflict? 
TEaching 
## Questions
1. The APAC engineering team that I'll be working with, what are they like? What's the culture and vibe? Very excited to hire, looking to convert to full time. Very friendly, very smart. 
2. Will there be training or mentorship programs available to interns? How does Viasat ensure that interns can maximize their learning and development during the internship?
3. How do you guys assess intern performance? What makes an intern stand out? 
4. So far in your search for an intern, are there some qualities that are missing in a lot of applicants? First time hiring, lots of logistics. hard to coordinate. Posted in July. Hard to brand. Interviews started very recently. No qualities missing. Interest , basic requirements. 

## Notes
1. Panel interview hiring manager, zoom. 
Technical interview. More like a conversation. 

2. Final interview over zoom. Just a conversation. 30 mins. Behavioural questions.
