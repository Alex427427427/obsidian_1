eng hard life

you can't just live for the weekend either. 

goal: find someone 
everyday after work come home safe space

no order of whether to have a career first but independence helps. once i create a space im comfy in. then might be better to have company other than my own. put in effort to the relo

loyalty - just chatting doesn't mean 

don't shit where you eat

don't take risk and save pot heart break later. 
Or, say you're young and still have some good memories. 

think of other aspects of life that could be fulfilling.
